### Problem Statement

We are given the heads of two sorted linked lists, `list1` and `list2`. Our task is to merge these two lists into a single sorted linked list by splicing together the nodes of the original lists. The merged list should also be sorted, and we need to return its head.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - Both `list1` and `list2` are individually sorted in ascending order.
  - We need to merge the nodes in sorted order by reusing the existing nodes from `list1` and `list2`, rather than creating new nodes.
  - The merged list should be linked correctly, and the original lists should no longer be used.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - One or both lists may be empty (`list1` or `list2` is `nullptr`).
  - All elements of one list are smaller than or larger than all elements of the other list.
  - Both lists contain a single node.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `list1 = [1,2,4]`, `list2 = [1,3,4]` → Output: `1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4`
  - **Example 2**: `list1 = []`, `list2 = [0]` → Output: `0`
  - **Example 3**: `list1 = [2,6,8]`, `list2 = [1,3,5]` → Output: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 6 -> 8`

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Linked list merging.
- **Pattern**: Since both lists are already sorted, we can merge them in sorted order using a **two-pointer** technique, where one pointer traverses `list1` and the other traverses `list2`.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To merge two sorted linked lists, we can use a two-pointer approach to compare the current nodes of both lists, appending the smaller node to the merged list. This avoids the need for additional data structures and keeps the solution in \(O(1)\) space.

1. **Initialize a Dummy Node**:
   - Use a dummy node to act as a placeholder for the merged list’s starting point. This helps simplify the merging logic and makes it easy to return the head of the merged list at the end.
   - Set a pointer `tail` to this dummy node, which will represent the last node of the merged list as we build it.

2. **Traverse and Compare Nodes**:
   - While neither `list1` nor `list2` is `nullptr`, compare the values of the current nodes of `list1` and `list2`.
   - Append the smaller node to `tail->next`, then advance `tail` and move the pointer (`list1` or `list2`) of the chosen node forward.

3. **Append Remaining Nodes**:
   - After exiting the loop, one of the lists may still have remaining nodes. Since both lists are sorted, we can attach the remaining nodes directly to `tail->next`.

4. **Return the Merged List**:
   - The merged list begins at `dummy->next`, so return `dummy->next` as the head of the merged sorted list.

This approach ensures \(O(n + m)\) time complexity, where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, respectively, with \(O(1)\) additional space.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ implementation of the plan:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* list1, ListNode* list2) {
        ListNode* temp = new ListNode(INT_MIN);
        
        ListNode* res = temp;
        
        while(list1 and list2){
            if(list1->val < list2->val){
                temp->next = list1;
                list1 = list1->next;
            }else{
                temp->next = list2;
                list2 = list2->next;
            }
            
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        
        if(list1) temp->next = list1;
        if(list2) temp->next = list2;
        
        return res->next;
    }
};
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - For `list1 = [1, 2, 4]` and `list2 = [1, 3, 4]`:
    - Initialize `dummy` and `tail`.
    - Compare nodes in each iteration, updating `tail->next` and advancing pointers.
    - Result: `1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4`.
  - For `list1 = []` and `list2 = [0]`:
    - Since `list1` is `nullptr`, directly attach `list2`.
    - Result: `0`.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - If both lists are empty, the function returns `nullptr`.
  - If one list is empty, the function attaches the other list directly.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`. We traverse each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we are merging the lists in place without additional data structures.
- **Strengths**: Efficient merging in minimal time and space complexity, with straightforward logic.
- **Weaknesses**: None; this approach is optimal for merging two sorted linked lists.

This solution efficiently merges two sorted linked lists in a single pass, preserving the sorted order with optimal time and space complexity.
