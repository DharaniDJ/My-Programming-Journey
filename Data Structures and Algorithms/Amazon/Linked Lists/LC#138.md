To solve the problem of making a deep copy of a linked list with random pointers, let’s use the UMPIRE approach to ensure a structured solution.

---

### Problem Statement

We are given the head of a linked list where each node contains:
1. A `next` pointer to the next node in the list.
2. A `random` pointer, which can point to any node in the list or `null`.

Our task is to create a **deep copy** of this list, meaning that each node in the copied list should be a new node with the same values and pointers as the original list, but no pointer in the copied list should reference nodes in the original list.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - Each node in the list has two pointers: `next` and `random`.
  - A deep copy means all nodes in the copied list should be new nodes, not sharing any memory with the original nodes.
  - The structure and `random` pointer connections in the copied list should exactly mirror those in the original list.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The list is empty (`head` is `null`).
  - All `random` pointers are `null`.
  - Some `random` pointers form cycles or point to earlier nodes.
  - The list contains only one node.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `head = [[7, null], [13, 0], [11, 4], [10, 2], [1, 0]]`
    - `Output`: A copied list with the same structure and random pointer connections.
  - **Example 2**: `head = [[1, 1], [2, 1]]`
    - A two-node list where each node’s `random` pointer points to itself.

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Linked list manipulation with random pointers.
- **Pattern**: To solve this efficiently, we can use **hashing** to map each original node to its corresponding new node, allowing us to correctly set both `next` and `random` pointers.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
Since each node has a `random` pointer that can point to any other node in the list (or `null`), creating a deep copy in a single pass is challenging. We’ll use an intermediate data structure (a hash map) to map each original node to its corresponding new node. This allows us to easily set both `next` and `random` pointers for each copied node.

1. **Create a Mapping from Original to Copied Nodes**:
   - Traverse the original list and create a new node for each original node, storing each new node in a hash map using the original node as the key. This map allows us to quickly find the corresponding copied node for any original node.

2. **Assign `next` and `random` Pointers**:
   - Traverse the original list again. For each node:
     - Set the `next` pointer of the copied node using the `next` pointer of the original node (via the hash map).
     - Set the `random` pointer of the copied node using the `random` pointer of the original node (via the hash map).

3. **Return the New Head**:
   - The copied list’s head is the node corresponding to the original head in the hash map.

This approach has \(O(n)\) time complexity due to two passes through the list and \(O(n)\) space complexity for the hash map.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ implementation of the plan:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node* random;

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        next = nullptr;
        random = nullptr;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        if (!head) return nullptr;  // If the list is empty, return null
        
        // Step 1: Create a mapping from original nodes to new nodes
        unordered_map<Node*, Node*> nodeMap;
        
        Node* current = head;
        while (current) {
            nodeMap[current] = new Node(current->val);  // Create a new node with the same value
            current = current->next;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Assign next and random pointers for each new node
        current = head;
        while (current) {
            nodeMap[current]->next = nodeMap[current->next];       // Set the next pointer
            nodeMap[current]->random = nodeMap[current->random];   // Set the random pointer
            current = current->next;
        }
        
        // Step 3: Return the head of the new list
        return nodeMap[head];
    }
};
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - For an input list where `head = [[7, null], [13, 0], [11, 4], [10, 2], [1, 0]]`:
    - **Step 1**: The hash map is created with each original node mapped to its corresponding new node with the same value.
    - **Step 2**: Each new node’s `next` and `random` pointers are set based on the original node’s connections.
    - **Result**: A deep copy of the list with all `next` and `random` pointers correctly assigned.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - For an empty list (`head = nullptr`), the function immediately returns `nullptr`.
  - For a single node, it correctly sets the `next` and `random` pointers to `nullptr` or the node itself if `random` points back to it.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the list. We make two passes over the list: one to create the nodes and populate the map, and one to set the `next` and `random` pointers.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), due to the hash map storing the mapping from original nodes to copied nodes.
- **Strengths**: This approach ensures all `next` and `random` pointers are correctly set in a single pass, with a straightforward implementation.
- **Weaknesses**: This solution requires \(O(n)\) extra space for the hash map, which could be optimized.

### Alternative Solution: Optimizing Space Complexity

We can avoid using extra space by weaving the copied nodes into the original list. Here’s how:
1. **Interleave Copied Nodes**: Insert each copied node immediately after its corresponding original node.
2. **Assign Random Pointers**: For each copied node, set its `random` pointer by referencing the `random` pointer of the original node.
3. **Separate the Lists**: Detach the copied nodes from the original nodes to form the final copied list.

This optimized solution has \(O(n)\) time complexity and \(O(1)\) extra space complexity. 


### Implementation

```cpp
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* next;
    Node* random;

    Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
        next = nullptr;
        random = nullptr;
    }
};

class Solution {
public:
    Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        if (!head) return nullptr;  // Return null if the list is empty
        
        // Step 1: Interleave copied nodes with original nodes
        Node* current = head;
        while (current) {
            Node* copy = new Node(current->val);
            copy->next = current->next;
            current->next = copy;
            current = copy->next;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Assign random pointers for the copied nodes
        current = head;
        while (current) {
            if (current->random) {
                current->next->random = current->random->next;
            }
            current = current->next->next;
        }
        
        // Step 3: Separate the copied list from the original list
        Node* dummy = new Node(0);  // Dummy node for the copied list
        Node* copyCurrent = dummy;
        current = head;
        
        while (current) {
            Node* copy = current->next;
            current->next = copy->next;  // Restore the original list
            
            copyCurrent->next = copy;  // Append to the copied list
            copyCurrent = copy;
            
            current = current->next;
        }
        
        return dummy->next;  // Return the head of the copied list
    }
};
```
