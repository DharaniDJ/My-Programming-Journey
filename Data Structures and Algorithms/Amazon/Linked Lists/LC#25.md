### Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time and return the modified list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k`, then the remaining nodes at the end should stay in their original order.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - We need to reverse nodes in groups of size `k`.
  - If fewer than `k` nodes remain at the end of the list, those nodes are not reversed.
  - Only the nodes themselves should be reversed, not their values.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - `k = 1`: No changes are made to the list since reversing one node at a time does nothing.
  - The list length is less than `k`: The entire list remains as is.
  - `k` equals the length of the list: Reverse the entire list.
  - The list length is a multiple of `k`: All nodes are reversed in groups without any leftover nodes at the end.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `k = 2` → Output: `2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5`
  - **Example 2**: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `k = 3` → Output: `3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5`
  - **Example 3**: `head = [1]`, `k = 1` → Output: `1`

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Linked list manipulation.
- **Pattern**: To reverse nodes in groups, we can break the problem down into segments of `k` nodes, reverse each segment, and link them together.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To reverse nodes in groups of `k`, we can iterate through the list in chunks. For each chunk of `k` nodes, we reverse the nodes in place and then link the reversed chunk to the next group. If there are fewer than `k` nodes left, we leave them as they are.

1. **Count the Nodes**:
   - First, count the total number of nodes to determine how many complete groups of `k` nodes exist.

2. **Reverse Each Group of `k` Nodes**:
   - Initialize a `dummy` node to simplify connecting the reversed segments.
   - Use pointers to mark the start and end of each `k`-node group.
   - For each group:
     - Check if there are enough nodes left to form a complete group of `k`.
     - Reverse the nodes within the group.
     - Link the reversed group to the previously reversed portion and prepare for the next group.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The modified list begins at `dummy->next`, so return `dummy->next` as the head of the modified list.

This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) as we visit each node once, and \(O(1)\) space complexity since we are reversing the nodes in place.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ implementation:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head, int k) {
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        while (k--) {
            ListNode* next = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
    
    ListNode* reverseKGroup(ListNode* head, int k) {
        if (!head || k == 1) return head;

        ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy->next = head;
        ListNode* prev = dummy;
        ListNode* end = head;
        
        while (end != nullptr) {
            // Check if there are at least k nodes left to reverse
            for (int i = 1; i < k && end != nullptr; i++) {
                end = end->next;
            }
            if (end == nullptr) break;

            // Reverse the k nodes
            ListNode* start = prev->next;
            ListNode* next = end->next;
            end->next = nullptr;
            prev->next = reverseList(start, k);
            start->next = next;

            // Move prev and end to the next group of k nodes
            prev = start;
            end = start->next;
        }

        return dummy->next;
    }
};
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - For `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 2`:
    - First group `[1, 2]` is reversed to `[2, 1]`.
    - Second group `[3, 4]` is reversed to `[4, 3]`.
    - Remaining node `[5]` is left as it is.
    - Result: `2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5`.
  - For `head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`:
    - First group `[1, 2, 3]` is reversed to `[3, 2, 1]`.
    - Remaining nodes `[4, 5]` are left as they are.
    - Result: `3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5`.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - If `k = 1`, the function returns the list as is.
  - If the length of the list is less than `k`, the function returns the list as is.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the list. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as the reversal is done in place with constant auxiliary space.
- **Strengths**: This solution efficiently reverses nodes in groups of `k` and handles leftover nodes as specified.
- **Weaknesses**: None; this approach is optimal for the problem constraints.

This solution reverses nodes in groups of `k`, preserving the order of any leftover nodes in the end, with optimal time and space complexity.
