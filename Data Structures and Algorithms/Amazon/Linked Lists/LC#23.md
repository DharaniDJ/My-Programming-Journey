### Problem Statement

We are given `k` sorted linked lists, each represented by a `ListNode` in ascending order. The task is to merge all the linked lists into one sorted linked list. The solution should have a time complexity of \(O(N \log k)\), where \(N\) is the total number of nodes across all lists, and \(k\) is the number of lists.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - Each input list is already sorted.
  - We need to merge all the lists while maintaining the sorted order.
  - The solution should have a time complexity of \(O(N \log k)\) and \(O(1)\) extra space, meaning we cannot use additional data structures like arrays or lists for storage.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `lists` is empty, return `nullptr`.
  - If all lists are empty, return `nullptr`.
  - If only one list is non-empty, return that list as it is.
  - Lists may vary in length.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]` → Output: `1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`
  - **Example 2**: `lists = [[]]` → Output: `nullptr`
  - **Example 3**: `lists = [[1,3,5]]` → Output: `1 -> 3 -> 5`

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Merging multiple sorted lists.
- **Pattern**: This problem is similar to merging `k` sorted arrays. Using a **min-heap** (or priority queue) to store the smallest element from each list would help maintain the sorted order during the merge.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To merge `k` sorted linked lists efficiently, we can use a **min-heap** to repeatedly get the smallest element among the heads of all lists. Each time we extract the smallest element, we move the corresponding list's head to the next node. By maintaining only the head of each list in the min-heap, we achieve an efficient merging process with \(O(N \log k)\) time complexity.

1. **Initialize a Min-Heap**:
   - Use a min-heap to store the smallest element among the heads of each list.
   - Insert the head of each non-empty list into the min-heap. Each heap element is a pair of the node’s value and a pointer to the node itself.

2. **Extract the Minimum and Build the Result List**:
   - Initialize a dummy node to help build the merged list.
   - While the heap is not empty:
     - Extract the node with the smallest value from the heap.
     - Append this node to the merged list.
     - If the extracted node has a next node, insert it into the heap to continue the merging process.
   
3. **Return the Result**:
   - The merged list is attached to the dummy node. Return `dummy->next` as the head of the final merged list.

This approach ensures \(O(N \log k)\) time complexity due to the heap operations and uses \(O(1)\) additional space, as we are modifying the existing nodes.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeKLists(vector<ListNode*>& lists) {
        // Min-heap to store the smallest elements among the heads of each list
        auto compare = [](ListNode* a, ListNode* b) { return a->val > b->val; };
        priority_queue<ListNode*, vector<ListNode*>, decltype(compare)> minHeap(compare);
        
        // Initialize the heap with the head of each list
        for (ListNode* list : lists) {
            if (list != nullptr) {
                minHeap.push(list);
            }
        }
        
        // Dummy node to start the merged list
        ListNode dummy;
        ListNode* tail = &dummy;
        
        // Process the heap until it's empty
        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            // Get the node with the smallest value
            ListNode* smallest = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            
            // Append it to the merged list
            tail->next = smallest;
            tail = tail->next;
            
            // If there are more nodes in this list, add the next node to the heap
            if (smallest->next != nullptr) {
                minHeap.push(smallest->next);
            }
        }
        
        return dummy.next;  // Return the head of the merged list
    }
};
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - For `lists = [[1,4,5], [1,3,4], [2,6]]`:
    - Initialize the heap with heads: `1 (from list 1), 1 (from list 2), 2 (from list 3)`.
    - Repeatedly extract the minimum and push the next node of the extracted node.
    - The merged list will correctly be `1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`.
  
- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - For an empty input `lists = []`, the function will return `nullptr`.
  - For input `lists = [[]]`, the function will also return `nullptr`.
  - For a single non-empty list, it returns that list as is.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \log k)\), where \(N\) is the total number of nodes across all lists, and \(k\) is the number of linked lists. The min-heap contains at most `k` elements at any time, and each insertion and extraction from the heap takes \(O(\log k)\) time.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for extra space, as we’re reusing the nodes of the original lists to form the merged list. However, the heap itself requires \(O(k)\) space.
- **Strengths**: Efficient merging while maintaining sorted order using minimal extra space.
- **Weaknesses**: The heap-based approach has a small space overhead of \(O(k)\) for storing list heads.
- **Potential Improvements**: None needed; this solution is optimal for the problem constraints.

This solution efficiently merges `k` sorted lists with the specified \(O(N \log k)\) time complexity and \(O(1)\) additional space complexity.

#### Follow up
#### Merge with Divide and Conquer

**Intuition**:
1. Pair up the `k` lists and merge each pair into a single sorted list.
2. After the first pairing, `k` lists are reduced to `k/2` lists, where each merged list has an average length of `2N/k`.
3. Repeat this pairing and merging process until only one merged sorted list remains.

**Time Complexity**: \(O(N \log k)\)
   - We perform approximately \(O(\log k)\) rounds of merging, and in each round, we process approximately \(O(N)\) nodes in total across all lists.

**Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
   - This approach modifies the lists in place and uses no additional data structures, making it optimal in terms of space.

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };

    ListNode* merge2Lists(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        ListNode head(0);
        ListNode* point = &head;
        while (l1 && l2) {
            if (l1->val <= l2->val) {
                point->next = l1;
                l1 = l1->next;
            } else {
                point->next = l2;
                l2 = l1;
                l1 = point->next->next;
            }
            point = point->next;
        }
        if (!l1) {
            point->next = l2;
        } else {
            point->next = l1;
        }
        return head.next;
    }

    ListNode* mergeKLists(vector<ListNode*>& lists) {
        int amount = lists.size();
        int interval = 1;
        
        while(interval < amount){
            for(int i=0; i < amount-interval; i+=(interval*2)){
                lists[i] = merge2Lists(lists[i], lists[i+interval]);
            }
