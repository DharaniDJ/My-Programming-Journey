To solve the problem of adding two numbers represented as linked lists, let’s go through it using the UMPIRE approach.

---

### Problem Statement

We are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, meaning the 1’s place is the head of the list. Our task is to add the two numbers and return the sum as a new linked list, with the sum also stored in reverse order.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - Each linked list represents an integer, with each node containing a digit from 0 to 9.
  - The numbers are stored in reverse order, so the first node is the least significant digit.
  - We need to handle the sum digit by digit, and if a sum exceeds 9, we carry the overflow to the next higher place.
  - The result should be a new linked list in reverse order.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - One or both lists may represent the number `0`.
  - The two numbers may be of different lengths (e.g., `list1` has 3 nodes and `list2` has 5 nodes).
  - The sum of the two numbers may produce an extra digit due to carry (e.g., `999 + 1` becomes `1000`).

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `list1 = [2,4,3]` and `list2 = [5,6,4]` → Output: `7 -> 0 -> 8` (because 342 + 465 = 807)
  - **Example 2**: `list1 = [0]` and `list2 = [0]` → Output: `0`
  - **Example 3**: `list1 = [9,9,9]` and `list2 = [1]` → Output: `0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1` (because 999 + 1 = 1000)

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Linked list manipulation and digit-by-digit addition.
- **Pattern**: We can simulate manual addition by processing each node from `list1` and `list2`, keeping track of any carry from the previous sum.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To add two numbers represented by linked lists, we start from the least significant digit and add corresponding nodes from both lists, similar to manual addition. We maintain a `carry` variable to handle any overflow from a sum that exceeds 9.

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use a dummy node as a placeholder for the result list. This helps simplify pointer manipulation.
   - Initialize a pointer `tail` to the dummy node, which will represent the last node in the resulting list as we build it.
   - Set `carry` to 0 to store any overflow from each addition.

2. **Iterate Through Both Lists**:
   - While there are nodes left in `list1` or `list2`, or there is a non-zero carry:
     - Retrieve the values from the current nodes of `list1` and `list2` (use 0 if a list is exhausted).
     - Calculate the sum of the values plus `carry`.
     - Update `carry` to `sum / 10` (to capture any overflow).
     - Create a new node with the value `sum % 10` and attach it to `tail`.
     - Move `tail` forward and advance the `list1` and `list2` pointers as needed.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The merged list begins at `dummy->next`, so return `dummy->next` as the head of the final result list.

This approach ensures \(O(\max(m, n))\) time complexity, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`, respectively, as we process each node only once.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ implementation:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        ListNode temp;
        ListNode* tail = &temp;
        int carry = 0;
        
        while(l1 or l2 or carry){
            int val1 = l1 ? l1->val : 0;
            int val2 = l2 ? l2->val : 0;
            
            int sum = val1 + val2 + carry;
            carry = sum/10;
            
            tail->next = new ListNode(sum%10);
            tail = tail->next;
            
            if(l1) l1 = l1->next;
            if(l2) l2 = l2->next;
        }
        
        return temp.next;
    }
};
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - For `list1 = [2,4,3]` and `list2 = [5,6,4]`:
    - Sum the corresponding nodes: `2 + 5 = 7`, `4 + 6 = 10` (carry 1), `3 + 4 + 1 = 8`.
    - Result: `7 -> 0 -> 8` (representing 807).
  - For `list1 = [9,9,9]` and `list2 = [1]`:
    - Sum the corresponding nodes: `9 + 1 = 10` (carry 1), `9 + 0 + 1 = 10` (carry 1), `9 + 0 + 1 = 10` (carry 1).
    - Extra carry creates a new node: `1`.
    - Result: `0 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1` (representing 1000).

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - Handles cases where lists have different lengths by treating missing nodes as 0.
  - If there is a leftover carry after processing all nodes, it correctly creates an additional node.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\max(m, n))\), where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `list1` and `list2`. We process each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), aside from the output linked list, as we only use a constant amount of extra space for the dummy node and carry.
- **Strengths**: Efficiently handles different lengths and handles carries correctly.
- **Weaknesses**: None; this solution is optimal for adding two linked-list-represented numbers.

This solution correctly handles the addition of two numbers represented by linked lists, including cases with carries, differing lengths, and zero values.
