### Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, we need to reverse the list and return the new head of the reversed list.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - We need to reverse the direction of all the links in the list, making the last node the new head.
  - The solution should handle lists of any length, including an empty list (where `head` is `nullptr`) and a single-node list.
  
- **Edge Cases**:
  - An empty list (head is `nullptr`) should return `nullptr`.
  - A single-node list should return the same node as the head.
  - A typical multi-node list should return a reversed list with the last node as the new head.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> nullptr` → Output: `5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> nullptr`
  - **Example 2**: `nullptr` → Output: `nullptr` (empty list)
  - **Example 3**: `1 -> nullptr` → Output: `1 -> nullptr` (single-node list)

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Linked list manipulation.
- **Pattern**: Reversing a linked list requires changing the direction of the `next` pointers. We can do this iteratively or recursively, but the iterative approach is generally more straightforward and has \(O(1)\) space complexity.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To reverse a linked list, we need to change each node’s `next` pointer to point to the previous node, making the list flow backward. We can achieve this by iterating through the list and keeping track of three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `next`. By systematically adjusting these pointers, we can reverse the list in one pass.

1. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - Set `prev` to `nullptr` to represent the end of the reversed list.
   - Set `curr` to `head` to start from the beginning of the list.

2. **Iterate Through the List**:
   - While `curr` is not `nullptr`:
     - Store the next node of `curr` in `next` (so we don’t lose the reference to the remaining list).
     - Update `curr->next` to point to `prev`, reversing the link.
     - Move `prev` to `curr` and `curr` to `next` to continue to the next node.

3. **Return the New Head**:
   - At the end of the loop, `prev` will be pointing to the new head of the reversed list (the last node of the original list).

This approach provides an efficient \(O(n)\) solution in both time and space complexity, where \(n\) is the number of nodes.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ code for this iterative approach:

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = head;
        
        while (curr != nullptr) {
            ListNode* next = curr->next;  // Store the next node
            curr->next = prev;            // Reverse the link
            prev = curr;                  // Move prev to curr
            curr = next;                  // Move curr to next
        }
        
        return prev;  // New head of the reversed list
    }
};
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - For `head = 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> nullptr`:
    - Initial state: `prev = nullptr`, `curr = 1`, `next = 2`
    - First iteration: `1 -> nullptr`, `prev = 1`, `curr = 2`
    - Second iteration: `2 -> 1 -> nullptr`, `prev = 2`, `curr = 3`
    - Continue until the list is reversed to `5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> nullptr`.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - For an empty list (`head = nullptr`), the function immediately returns `nullptr`.
  - For a single-node list (`head = 1 -> nullptr`), the function correctly returns `1 -> nullptr`.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the list. We traverse each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we only use a constant amount of extra space for pointers.
- **Strengths**: Efficient and straightforward solution with optimal time and space complexity.
- **Weaknesses**: None; this solution is optimal for the problem constraints.
- **Potential Improvements**: The recursive approach is an alternative, but it may consume more stack space, making the iterative approach preferable for large lists.

This iterative solution efficiently reverses the linked list in one pass, with minimal memory usage.
