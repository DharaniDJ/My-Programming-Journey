### Problem Statement

We are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on day `i`. We want to maximize profit by choosing one day to buy and a future day to sell. The objective is to:
- Return the maximum profit achievable from this transaction.
- Return `0` if no profit can be achieved.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - We are only allowed to make one buy and one sell.
  - We must buy the stock before selling it, meaning the buy day must be earlier than the sell day.
  - If no profit is possible (prices are non-increasing), return `0`.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - Example 1: `prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`
    - Buy on day 2 at price 1 and sell on day 5 at price 6 for a profit of `6 - 1 = 5`.
  - Example 2: `prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]`
    - No profit possible, so return `0`.

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Array traversal with tracking minimum and maximum values.
- **Pattern**:
  - Track the minimum price encountered so far as we iterate over the array.
  - For each price, calculate the profit by selling at the current price minus the minimum price observed before it.
  - Update the maximum profit if this calculated profit is greater than the current maximum profit.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
The core idea is to keep track of the lowest price encountered so far as we move through the array. For each price:
1. Calculate the potential profit if we were to sell at this price after buying at the lowest price seen so far.
2. Update the maximum profit if this profit is greater than the previously recorded maximum profit.
3. Update the minimum price if the current price is lower than the previous minimum price.

### Steps

1. **Initialize**:
   - Set `minPrice` to a very high initial value (e.g., `INT_MAX`).
   - Set `maxProfit` to 0, as we want to maximize this value.

2. **Iterate Over Prices**:
   - For each price in the `prices` array:
     - Update `minPrice` if the current price is lower.
     - Calculate the potential profit as `currentPrice - minPrice`.
     - Update `maxProfit` if this profit is higher than the previous `maxProfit`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating through the array, `maxProfit` will hold the maximum profit that can be achieved.
   - If no profit is possible (all prices are non-increasing), `maxProfit` will remain `0`.

### Example Walkthrough

- **Example 1**: `prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]`
  - `minPrice = INT_MAX`, `maxProfit = 0`
  - Day 1: Price = 7 → `minPrice = 7`
  - Day 2: Price = 1 → `minPrice = 1`
  - Day 3: Price = 5 → Potential profit = `5 - 1 = 4` → `maxProfit = 4`
  - Day 4: Price = 3 → Potential profit = `3 - 1 = 2` → `maxProfit = 4`
  - Day 5: Price = 6 → Potential profit = `6 - 1 = 5` → `maxProfit = 5`
  - Day 6: Price = 4 → Potential profit = `4 - 1 = 3` → `maxProfit = 5`
  - Final result: `maxProfit = 5`

- **Example 2**: `prices = [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]`
  - The prices are in descending order, so the maximum profit remains `0`.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the C++ code:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int minPrice = INT_MAX;
        int maxProfit = 0;

        for (int price : prices) {
            // Update the minimum price if we find a new lower price
            minPrice = min(minPrice, price);

            // Calculate the profit if selling at the current price
            int profit = price - minPrice;

            // Update the maximum profit if this profit is higher
            maxProfit = max(maxProfit, profit);
        }

        return maxProfit;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `minPrice` is set to a very high initial value (`INT_MAX`) to ensure it gets updated on the first iteration.
   - `maxProfit` is initialized to 0 since, initially, no profit is made.

2. **Iteration Over Prices**:
   - For each `price` in `prices`:
     - `minPrice` is updated if the current price is lower than the previous minimum.
     - `profit` is calculated as `price - minPrice`.
     - `maxProfit` is updated if `profit` is greater than the previous maximum profit.

3. **Return Result**:
   - After the loop, `maxProfit` holds the maximum achievable profit.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of days. We only iterate through the `prices` array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we are only using a few variables to track the minimum price and maximum profit.

This solution efficiently finds the maximum profit by keeping track of the minimum price and calculating potential profits as we iterate through the prices.
