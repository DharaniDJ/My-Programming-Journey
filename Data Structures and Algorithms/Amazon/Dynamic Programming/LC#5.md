### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find and return the longest substring of `s` that is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as "madam" or "racecar".
  - If there are multiple palindromic substrings with the same maximum length, any one of them can be returned.
  - Single characters are palindromic, so the minimum possible length of the output is 1.
  
- **Example Test Cases**:
  - `s = "babad"` → Output: `"bab"` (or `"aba"`, since both are palindromic)
  - `s = "cbbd"` → Output: `"bb"`
  - `s = "a"` → Output: `"a"`
  - `s = "ac"` → Output: `"a"` (or `"c"`)

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: String manipulation with palindrome detection.
- **Pattern**:
  - The "Expand From Centers" approach works well for finding palindromic substrings.
  - For each character (or pair of characters) in the string, we attempt to expand outwards, checking if the substring remains a palindrome.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
The longest palindrome in a string can be found by expanding around possible centers:
1. Each character can be the center of an odd-length palindrome.
2. Each pair of consecutive characters can be the center of an even-length palindrome.

**Steps**:
1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `start` and `end` to keep track of the starting and ending indices of the longest palindromic substring found so far.

2. **Expand Around Centers**:
   - For each character in the string, treat it as a center and attempt to expand outward to find the longest palindromic substring centered at this character.
   - Expand twice: once for odd-length palindromes (single character center) and once for even-length palindromes (two-character center).
   - If a longer palindromic substring is found, update `start` and `end`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Use the `start` and `end` indices to extract the longest palindromic substring from `s`.

### Helper Function

Define a helper function `expandAroundCenter`:
- This function takes `left` and `right` as the starting indices for expansion and checks for palindrome by expanding outward.
- It returns the length of the longest palindrome centered at `left` and `right`.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the C++ code for the "Expand From Centers" approach:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string expand(string &s, int i, int j){
        while(i>=0 and j<s.size() and s[i]==s[j]){
            i--;
            j++;
        }

        return s.substr(i+1, j-i-1);
    }

    string longestPalindrome(string s) {

        int n = s.size();

        string ans = "";

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            string temp = expand(s,i,i);
            if(temp.size()>ans.size()){
                ans = temp;
            }

            temp = expand(s,i,i+1);
            if(temp.size()>ans.size()){
                ans = temp;
            }

        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Expand Around Centers**:
   - We loop through each character and expand outward from that character (for odd-length palindromes) and from each pair of characters (for even-length palindromes).
   - We calculate the length of the palindrome for each expansion and compare it to the maximum length found so far.

2. **Update `start` and `end`**:
   - If a longer palindrome is found, we update `start` and `end` to mark the boundaries of this palindrome.

3. **Extract the Longest Palindromic Substring**:
   - After the loop, `start` and `end` represent the boundaries of the longest palindromic substring, so we return `s.substr(start, end - start + 1)`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.
  - We iterate through each character and expand around it, which takes \(O(n)\) time per expansion.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we only use a fixed amount of additional space for variables.

### Example Walkthrough

For `s = "babad"`:
1. At `i = 0`: Expands around `"b"` and finds `"bab"`.
2. At `i = 1`: Expands around `"a"` and finds `"aba"`.
3. At `i = 2`: Expands around `"b"` and finds `"bab"`.
4. The longest palindrome found is `"bab"` (or `"aba"`).

We could also solve this problem using a **Dynamic Programming (DP)** approach, where we build a table to track whether each substring is a palindrome. This approach has a **time complexity of \(O(n^2)\)** and a **space complexity of \(O(n^2)\)**, as we need a 2D table to store the results for each possible substring.

However, due to the **\(O(n^2)\) space complexity**, the **"Expand From Centers" approach** is often preferred, as it achieves **\(O(1)\) space complexity** and is more space-efficient, especially for large inputs.

This approach efficiently finds the longest palindromic substring using the "Expand From Centers" technique, ensuring we consider both odd- and even-length palindromes.
