### Problem Statement

We are given an integer array `nums`. We need to find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return that sum.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - We’re looking for a **contiguous subarray** with the maximum sum.
  - The array may contain negative numbers, so the largest sum could be any subset of the array, including a single element if all others are negative.
  - We only need to return the largest sum itself, not the actual subarray.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `nums = [−2,1,−3,4,−1,2,1,−5,4]` → Output: `6` (subarray `[4,−1,2,1]` has the largest sum)
  - **Example 2**: `nums = [1]` → Output: `1` (only one element)
  - **Example 3**: `nums = [5,4,−1,7,8]` → Output: `23` (entire array is the max subarray)

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Subarray sum problem.
- **Pattern**: **Dynamic Programming** or **Greedy Approach** (Kadane’s Algorithm) is suitable for this problem, as it allows us to efficiently find the maximum sum in a single pass by maintaining a running sum and resetting it if it becomes negative.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
Using Kadane’s Algorithm, we can maintain a running sum of the subarray and decide whether to continue adding to this sum or start fresh from the current element.

1. Initialize two variables:
   - `maxSum` to keep track of the maximum sum found so far. Set it to the smallest possible integer initially or the first element of `nums`.
   - `currentSum` to track the sum of the current subarray. Initialize it to `0`.

2. Iterate through each element in `nums`:
   - Update `currentSum` by adding the current element.
   - If `currentSum` is greater than `maxSum`, update `maxSum`.
   - If `currentSum` becomes negative, reset `currentSum` to `0` because a negative sum would reduce the overall maximum if we continued with it.

3. At the end of the loop, `maxSum` will hold the maximum subarray sum.

This approach ensures that we find the maximum subarray sum in \(O(n)\) time complexity.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ code implementing this approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxSum = INT_MIN;  // To store the maximum subarray sum found so far
        int currentSum = 0;     // To track the current subarray sum

        for (int num : nums) {
            currentSum += num;  // Add the current number to the current sum
            maxSum = max(maxSum, currentSum);  // Update maxSum if currentSum is greater
            if (currentSum < 0) {  // If currentSum becomes negative, reset it to 0
                currentSum = 0;
            }
        }

        return maxSum;  // Return the largest sum found
    }
};
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - For `nums = [−2,1,−3,4,−1,2,1,−5,4]`:
    - Start with `maxSum = INT_MIN` and `currentSum = 0`.
    - Iterate through `nums`, updating `currentSum` and `maxSum` as follows:
      - `currentSum` grows or resets, and whenever it’s greater than `maxSum`, `maxSum` is updated.
    - Result: `maxSum` is `6` at the end, corresponding to the subarray `[4,−1,2,1]`.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - **Single Element**: For a single element (e.g., `nums = [1]`), `maxSum` becomes `1`, which is correct.
  - **All Negative Elements**: The algorithm correctly handles cases where all elements are negative by choosing the least negative number.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums`, as we only iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we only use a fixed amount of additional space for `maxSum` and `currentSum`.
- **Strengths**: This solution is efficient, handling both positive and negative numbers in linear time with constant space.
- **Weaknesses**: None for this problem; Kadane’s algorithm is optimal.

This solution efficiently computes the maximum subarray sum using Kadane’s Algorithm, achieving the best possible time complexity of \(O(n)\).
