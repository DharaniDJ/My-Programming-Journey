To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of coins required to make a given amount, let’s go through it using the UMPIRE approach, and implement the solution using recursion with memoization.

---

### Problem Statement

You are given:
- An integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations.
- An integer `amount` representing the total amount of money.

The task:
- Return the fewest number of coins needed to make up that `amount`.
- If it’s not possible to make up that amount with the given coins, return `-1`.

Assumptions:
- You have an infinite supply of each coin denomination.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - We need to minimize the number of coins needed to sum up to `amount`.
  - If the `amount` is 0, the answer is 0 (no coins are needed).
  - If `amount` cannot be formed using any combination of coins, return `-1`.
  
- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    - `coins = [1, 2, 5]`, `amount = 11`
    - Expected output: `3` (e.g., 5 + 5 + 1)
  - **Example 2**:
    - `coins = [2]`, `amount = 3`
    - Expected output: `-1` (cannot make 3 with only 2s)
  - **Example 3**:
    - `coins = [1]`, `amount = 0`
    - Expected output: `0` (no coins needed)

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Minimum number of elements to achieve a target sum.
- **Pattern**: This is a classic **Dynamic Programming (DP)** problem that can be solved using recursion with memoization:
  - We can recursively try each coin denomination, subtract it from the `amount`, and count the coins used.
  - By storing results of subproblems (memoization), we avoid recalculating solutions for the same `amount`.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To find the minimum number of coins:
1. Start with the target `amount` and attempt to make it by subtracting each coin denomination.
2. For each coin, recursively calculate the minimum number of coins needed for the remaining amount (`amount - coin`).
3. Use memoization to store results of subproblems so that each amount is computed only once.
4. If any `amount` reaches exactly `0`, return `0` because no more coins are needed.

### Steps

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `amount` is `0`, return `0` (no coins are needed).
   - If `amount` is negative, return a large number (infinity), as it represents an impossible solution.

2. **Recursive Relation**:
   - For each coin, recursively find the minimum number of coins needed for `amount - coin`.
   - Track the minimum across all recursive calls.

3. **Memoization**:
   - Store the results of each subproblem (for each `amount`) in a memoization table (`memo`) to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Result**:
   - If the result in `memo[amount]` is infinity (or a large number), return `-1` (indicating no solution).
   - Otherwise, return the minimum number of coins found.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the C++ code using recursion with memoization:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int solve(vector<int>& coins, int amount, vector<int>& dp) {
        if (amount == 0) return 0;
        
        if (amount < 0) return -1;
        
        if (dp[amount] != 0) return dp[amount];
        
        int minCoins = INT_MAX;
        
        for (int coin : coins) {
            int result = solve(coins, amount - coin, dp);
            
            if (result >= 0 && result < minCoins) {
                minCoins = result + 1;
            }
        }
        
        dp[amount] = (minCoins == INT_MAX) ? -1 : minCoins;
        return dp[amount];
    }
    
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        if(amount < 1) return 0;
        vector<int> dp(amount+1,0);
        return solve(coins, amount, dp);
    }
};
 
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **coinChangeHelper**:
   - This recursive helper function takes an `amount`, the `coins` vector, and a `memo` map.
   - If `amount == 0`, it returns `0` because no coins are needed.
   - If `amount < 0`, it returns `INT_MAX` to signify an invalid solution.
   - It then checks if the result for the current `amount` has already been computed in `memo`. If so, it returns the memoized result.
   - For each coin, the function recursively calculates the minimum coins needed for `amount - coin`. If a valid result (`res != INT_MAX`) is returned, it updates `minCoins`.

2. **Memoization**:
   - `memo[amount]` stores the minimum number of coins needed for each amount encountered, reducing redundant computations.

3. **coinChange**:
   - Initializes the `memo` map and calls `coinChangeHelper` with the initial amount.
   - If `result` is `INT_MAX`, it returns `-1` (indicating no solution exists). Otherwise, it returns `result`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(amount \times n)\), where `amount` is the target amount and `n` is the number of coins. Each subproblem for every amount up to `amount` is solved only once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(amount)\) for the memoization map storing the minimum coins for each sub-amount.

This solution effectively minimizes the number of coins needed to reach a target amount using recursion with memoization, ensuring that each unique subproblem is computed only once.
