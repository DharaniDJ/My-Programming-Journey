### UMPIRE Approach

#### **1. Understand**
- We have a board of characters and a list of target words.
- The goal is to find all words from the list that can be formed by sequentially adjacent cells in the grid (either horizontally or vertically).
- Each cell may be used only once per word.

- **Example Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    - `board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]]`
    - `words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]`
    - Expected Output: `["oath","eat"]`
  - **Example 2**:
    - `board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]]`
    - `words = ["abcd"]`
    - Expected Output: `[]`

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Grid traversal with word search and constraints.
- **Pattern**: This is a backtracking problem, where each cell in the grid can be explored recursively to form words. To efficiently manage the list of words and check for prefixes, we can use a Trie data structure.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
We can view this as a modified crossword search. The plan is to start from each cell, explore all directions, and check if we can build any word from the `words` list. To avoid exploring invalid paths early, we use a Trie to efficiently check prefixes.

### Steps

1. **Build a Trie**:
   - Insert each word from the `words` list into a Trie, marking the end of each word in the Trie for easy recognition.

2. **Backtracking Search**:
   - For each cell in the board, initiate a backtracking search if the character matches any prefix in the Trie.
   - In each recursive call:
     - Mark the cell as visited.
     - Explore all four directions (up, down, left, right).
     - If a complete word is found in the Trie during exploration, add it to the result list.
     - Stop exploring a path if it no longer matches any prefix in the Trie.
     - Restore the cellâ€™s value after backtracking.

3. **Optimize**:
   - To prevent duplicate entries, mark words as found in the Trie after adding them to the result.
   - Prune the Trie to remove nodes that are no longer needed, which helps reduce the search space.

### Implementation in C++

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
public:
    unordered_map<char, TrieNode*> children;
    string word; // Stores the complete word at end nodes
    
    TrieNode() : word("") {}
};

class Trie {
public:
    TrieNode* root;
    
    Trie() { root = new TrieNode(); }
    
    void insert(const string& word) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (char c : word) {
            if (!node->children.count(c)) {
                node->children[c] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node->children[c];
        }
        node->word = word; // Mark end of word
    }
};

class Solution {
private:
    vector<string> result;
    vector<vector<int>> directions = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    
    void backtrack(vector<vector<char>>& board, int row, int col, TrieNode* node) {
        char letter = board[row][col];
        TrieNode* currNode = node->children[letter];
        
        if (!currNode->word.empty()) {
            result.push_back(currNode->word);
            currNode->word = ""; // Avoid duplicate entries in the result
        }
        
        board[row][col] = '#'; // Mark cell as visited
        
        for (const auto& dir : directions) {
            int newRow = row + dir[0];
            int newCol = col + dir[1];
            
            if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < board.size() && newCol >= 0 && newCol < board[0].size() && board[newRow][newCol] != '#' && currNode->children.count(board[newRow][newCol])) {
                backtrack(board, newRow, newCol, currNode);
            }
        }
        
        board[row][col] = letter; // Restore cell value
        
        if (currNode->children.empty()) {
            node->children.erase(letter); // Prune unneeded nodes
            delete currNode;
        }
    }

public:
    vector<string> findWords(vector<vector<char>>& board, vector<string>& words) {
        Trie trie;
        for (const string& word : words) {
            trie.insert(word);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].size(); ++j) {
                if (trie.root->children.count(board[i][j])) {
                    backtrack(board, i, j, trie.root);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \cdot 4^L)\), where:
  - \(N\) is the number of cells in the board.
  - \(L\) is the maximum length of words in `words`.
  - Each cell can lead to up to 4 recursive calls (though restricted to 3 directions after the first step).

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(W \cdot L)\) for the Trie, where \(W\) is the number of words and \(L\) is the maximum length of a word. The call stack depth for backtracking requires \(O(L)\) space.
