### Problem Analysis

The problem requires finding a target in a rotated sorted array. The array was originally sorted in ascending order and rotated at an unknown pivot. We need to find the target element in \(O(log n)) time, suggesting the use of binary search or a modified binary search.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**: 
  - The array is sorted and then rotated, so it has two sorted subarrays.
  - We should return the index of the target if found; otherwise, return \(-1\).
  - Edge cases to consider:
    - If the array is not rotated (i.e., a regular sorted array).
    - If the target is not present.
    - If the target is the pivot element.

- **Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0` → Output: `4`
  - **Example 2**: `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3` → Output: `-1`
  - **Example 3**: `nums = [1], target = 0` → Output: `-1`
  - **Example 4**: `nums = [1], target = 1` → Output: `0`

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: This is a modified binary search problem.
- **Pattern**: Rotated sorted array search. We can leverage the fact that one half of the array (either left or right) will always be sorted. By identifying which half is sorted, we can decide which half to continue searching in.

#### **3. Plan**
- Use binary search to identify which part of the array to explore:
  1. Set two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the start and end of the array.
  2. Find the middle element.
  3. Determine if the left half or the right half is sorted.
  4. Check if the target is in the sorted half. If it is, narrow the search to that half. Otherwise, search in the other half.
  5. Repeat the process until the target is found or the search range is exhausted.

#### **4. Implement**

Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int left = 0, right = n - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        // Case 1: Find target
        if (nums[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        }
        // Case 2: Subarray on mid's left is sorted
        else if (nums[mid] >= nums[left]) {
            if (target >= nums[left] && target < nums[mid]) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        // Case 3: Subarray on mid's right is sorted
        else {
            if (target <= nums[right] && target > nums[mid]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
    }
    return -1;
}
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Run**: For `nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` and `target = 0`, the code checks the array by identifying sorted halves and will ultimately narrow down to the element at index `4`, returning the correct result.
- **Edge Case**: For a single element array `nums = [1]` and `target = 1`, the function correctly returns `0`.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(\log n)\), as we are using a binary search-based approach.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we are only using constant extra space.
- **Strengths**: Efficient, meets the \(O(\log n)\) requirement.
- **Weaknesses**: The algorithm assumes distinct values, so it may need adjustments if duplicates were allowed (not the case here).
- **Potential Improvements**: This algorithm is optimal for the given constraints. Further optimizations are unnecessary without changing the problem requirements.

This solution is efficient, concise, and solves the problem within the required time complexity.
