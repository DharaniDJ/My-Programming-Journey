### Problem Statement

We are given a 1-indexed array `numbers` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order. We need to find two numbers such that they add up to a given target and return their indices (1-indexed) as `[index1, index2]`. Only one solution exists, and we may not use the same element twice.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - We need to find two distinct indices in the sorted array where the sum of the numbers at these indices equals the target.
  - Since the array is 1-indexed, we must increment our final indices by one before returning.
  - Only one solution exists, so we don’t need to account for multiple solutions.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - Minimum-sized input (array with only two elements).
  - Numbers near the target on opposite ends of the array.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9` → Output: `[1, 2]` (since `2 + 7 = 9`)
  - **Example 2**: `numbers = [2, 3, 4]`, `target = 6` → Output: `[1, 3]`
  - **Example 3**: `numbers = [-1, 0]`, `target = -1` → Output: `[1, 2]`

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Two-pointer technique.
- **Pattern**: Using two pointers on a sorted array allows us to efficiently check sums without needing additional space, achieving \(O(n)\) time complexity.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
Given that the array is sorted, we can use a two-pointer approach to efficiently find the pair that sums up to the target. One pointer (`left`) starts at the beginning of the array, and the other pointer (`right`) starts at the end. By adjusting these pointers based on the sum of their respective values, we can find the correct indices without needing extra space.

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**:
   - Set `left` to the start of the array (index 0) and `right` to the end (index `numbers.size() - 1`).

2. **Adjust Pointers Based on Sum**:
   - Calculate the current sum of `numbers[left] + numbers[right]`.
   - If the sum equals the target, we have found our solution, and we return `[left + 1, right + 1]` (1-indexed).
   - If the sum is less than the target, move the `left` pointer one step right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than the target, move the `right` pointer one step left to decrease the sum.

3. **Return Result**:
   - The loop will terminate once the correct pair is found, as the problem guarantees exactly one solution.

This two-pointer technique allows us to achieve \(O(n)\) time complexity and \(O(1)\) space complexity, which is optimal for this problem.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ implementation of the plan:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.size() - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        int sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right];

        if (sum == target) {
            // Return 1-indexed positions
            return {left + 1, right + 1};
        } else if (sum < target) {
            left++;  // Move left pointer right to increase the sum
        } else {
            right--; // Move right pointer left to decrease the sum
        }
    }

    // Return empty vector if no solution (though problem guarantees a solution)
    return {};
}
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - For `numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15]` and `target = 9`:
    - Initial pointers: `left = 0`, `right = 3`
    - `numbers[left] + numbers[right] = 2 + 15 = 17` (too high), so move `right` left to `2`
    - Now, `numbers[left] + numbers[right] = 2 + 7 = 9`, which matches the target. Return `[1, 2]`.
  - For `numbers = [2, 3, 4]` and `target = 6`, it correctly finds indices `[1, 3]`.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - Minimum input size (e.g., two elements) works since there’s exactly one solution.
  - The function handles cases where the sum is either too high or too low by adjusting the pointers accordingly.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), as we are only making a single pass through the array with two pointers.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we only use constant space for pointers and don’t require additional data structures.
- **Strengths**: Efficient and simple solution using the two-pointer technique, optimal for sorted arrays.
- **Weaknesses**: None within given constraints.
- **Potential Improvements**: The solution is optimal for the problem constraints.

This solution efficiently finds the two indices using a two-pointer approach, achieving optimal time and space complexity.

### Follow-Up: Handling Integer Overflow

If the problem constraints required us to consider integer overflow when adding `numbers[left]` and `numbers[right]`, we could use the following approach:

- **Overflow-Aware Sum**:
  - Instead of directly calculating `sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]`, we can check for overflow using conditional logic:
    - If `target - numbers[left] == numbers[right]`, then `numbers[left] + numbers[right]` equals the target without overflow.
    - This avoids directly adding the two values, thereby sidestepping overflow issues.

Here’s a modified version of the code with overflow handling:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = numbers.size() - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        // Check for overflow-safe sum
        if (target - numbers[left] == numbers[right]) {
            return {left + 1, right + 1};  // 1-indexed result
        } else if (target - numbers[left] > numbers[right]) {
            left++;  // Increase sum by moving left pointer right
        } else {
            right--; // Decrease sum by moving right pointer left
        }
    }

    return {};
}
```

This version avoids potential overflow by comparing `target - numbers[left]` with `numbers[right]`, ensuring that the addition step does not directly cause overflow.
