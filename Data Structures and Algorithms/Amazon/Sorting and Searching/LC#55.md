### Problem Statement

We are given a list of intervals, where each interval is represented as `[start, end]`. Our task is to merge all overlapping intervals and return a list of non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - We need to combine intervals that overlap into single intervals.
  - Two intervals overlap if the end of one interval is equal to or greater than the start of the next.
  - If the intervals are non-overlapping already, we simply return them as they are.
  - Edge cases include:
    - A single interval (nothing to merge).
    - All intervals are non-overlapping.
    - All intervals are overlapping into one large interval.

- **Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]` → Merged: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
  - **Example 2**: `intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]` → Merged: `[[1,5]]`
  - **Example 3**: `intervals = [[1,4],[2,3]]` → Merged: `[[1,4]]`
  - **Example 4**: `intervals = [[1,4]]` → Merged: `[[1,4]]` (Single interval)
  - **Example 5**: `intervals = [[1,4],[5,6]]` → Merged: `[[1,4],[5,6]]` (Non-overlapping intervals)

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Sorting and merging intervals.
- **Pattern**: When intervals are sorted by their start values, merging becomes easier as overlapping intervals will appear consecutively in the sorted list. This lets us traverse the list once, checking each interval with the last merged interval.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
Sorting the intervals by their start times makes it easy to manage merging. Once sorted, any overlapping intervals will appear consecutively, enabling us to check only adjacent intervals for merging. This allows a linear pass through the list after sorting, resulting in an efficient \(O(n \log n)\) solution.

To merge intervals efficiently, we can use the following approach:

1. **Sort the Intervals by Start Time**:
   - Sorting the intervals based on their start time ensures that any intervals that can be merged are adjacent. This creates a "contiguous run" of intervals that either overlap or don’t.
   
2. **Merge Intervals**:
   - Initialize an empty list, `merged`, to store merged intervals.
   - Iterate over each interval in the sorted list:
     - If `merged` is empty or the current interval does not overlap with the last interval in `merged` (i.e., the `end` of the last merged interval is less than the `start` of the current interval), simply add the current interval to `merged`.
     - If the current interval does overlap, update the `end` of the last interval in `merged` to the maximum of the current interval’s `end` and the last interval’s `end`. This effectively merges the intervals.
   
3. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing all intervals, `merged` will contain the non-overlapping merged intervals. Return this list as the final result.


#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ implementation based on the plan:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
    // Step 1: Sort intervals by start time
    sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());

    // Step 2: Initialize merged intervals list
    vector<vector<int>> merged;
    
    for (const auto& interval : intervals) {
        // If merged is empty or there's no overlap, add the interval
        if (merged.empty() || merged.back()[1] < interval[0]) {
            merged.push_back(interval);
        } else {
            // If there is overlap, merge the current interval with the last interval
            merged.back()[1] = max(merged.back()[1], interval[1]);
        }
    }
    
    // Step 3: Return the merged intervals
    return merged;
}
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - For `intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`:
    1. Sort intervals: `[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`
    2. Merge `[1,3]` and `[2,6]` to form `[1,6]`.
    3. Add `[8,10]` and `[15,18]` as they don’t overlap with previous intervals.
    - Output: `[[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`.
  - For `intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]`, the intervals are already sorted. Merge them to get `[[1,5]]`.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - For a single interval, like `[[1,4]]`, the function correctly returns `[[1,4]]`.
  - For non-overlapping intervals, like `[[1,3],[5,7]]`, the function correctly returns each interval without merging.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of intervals. Sorting takes \(O(n \log n)\), and merging takes \(O(n)\), so the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), for the output list `merged`, which stores the merged intervals.
- **Strengths**: Efficient and straightforward, leveraging sorting and a single pass through the intervals to handle merging.
- **Weaknesses**: Sorting is necessary, so the time complexity is limited by \(O(n \log n)\) due to this initial step.
- **Potential Improvements**: The solution is optimal given the problem’s constraints.

This solution effectively handles merging by sorting the intervals first, making it easy to manage overlaps with a linear scan after sorting.
