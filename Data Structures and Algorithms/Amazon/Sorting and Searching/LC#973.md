### Problem Statement

We are given an array `points` where each point is represented as `[x, y]` on the X-Y plane, and an integer `k`. We need to return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`. The distance between a point `(x, y)` and the origin is the Euclidean distance `√(x^2 + y^2)`.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - The Euclidean distance formula is used, but we only need to compare the squared distances to avoid the computation cost of the square root.
  - We can return the `k` closest points in any order.
  - The solution must efficiently handle large inputs where `k` could be much smaller than the total number of points.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `points` has only one point and `k = 1`, return that point.
  - If all points are at the same distance, return any `k` points.
  - If `k` equals the number of points, return all points.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `points = [[1,3],[3,4],[2,-1]]`, `k = 2` → Output: Any two points closest to the origin, e.g., `[[1,3],[2,-1]]`.
  - **Example 2**: `points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]`, `k = 1` → Output: `[[1,1]]`.

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Finding the top `k` closest elements based on a calculated metric.
- **Pattern**: Using a max-heap (priority queue) of size `k` allows us to keep track of the `k` smallest distances. By maintaining the largest distance within the `k` closest points, we can efficiently manage the points closest to the origin.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
We need to select the `k` points with the smallest distances from the origin `(0, 0)`. Instead of sorting the entire array, which would be inefficient, we can use a max-heap of size `k` to maintain only the closest `k` points. This approach avoids the overhead of sorting all points.

1. **Calculate Squared Distances**:
   - For each point `(x, y)`, calculate its squared distance to the origin as `x^2 + y^2`. Using the squared distance avoids unnecessary square root calculations and preserves relative distances.

2. **Use a Max-Heap of Size `k`**:
   - Initialize a max-heap to store points along with their squared distances.
   - For each point in `points`:
     - Calculate the squared distance and push the point into the heap.
     - If the heap size exceeds `k`, remove the point with the largest distance (root of the max-heap).
   - After processing all points, the heap will contain the `k` closest points.

3. **Extract the Result**:
   - Convert the heap elements into the result vector and return it. Since the heap stores only the `k` closest points, they can be returned in any order.

This approach ensures an efficient solution with a time complexity of \(O(n \log k)\), where \(n\) is the number of points.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ implementation of the plan:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
        // Max-heap to keep track of the k closest points
        priority_queue<pair<int, vector<int>>> maxHeap;
        
        for (const auto& point : points) {
            int x = point[0];
            int y = point[1];
            int dist = x * x + y * y;  // Squared Euclidean distance
            
            // Push the current point with its distance
            maxHeap.push({dist, point});
            
            // If the heap exceeds size k, remove the farthest point
            if (maxHeap.size() > k) {
                maxHeap.pop();
            }
        }
        
        // Extract the points from the heap
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        while (!maxHeap.empty()) {
            result.push_back(maxHeap.top().second);
            maxHeap.pop();
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - For `points = [[1,3],[3,4],[2,-1]]` and `k = 2`:
    - The squared distances are `1^2 + 3^2 = 10`, `3^2 + 4^2 = 25`, and `2^2 + (-1)^2 = 5`.
    - After inserting points into the max-heap and maintaining only `k` closest points, the heap retains the two points with the smallest distances: `[[1,3], [2,-1]]`.
  - For `points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]` and `k = 1`, only the point `[1,1]` with the smallest distance is retained in the heap.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - Single-point input, such as `points = [[0,0]]` and `k = 1`, returns `[[0,0]]`.
  - If `k` equals the number of points, all points are returned.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log k)\), where \(n\) is the number of points. Inserting into the heap takes \(O(\log k)\) for each point, and we only keep `k` elements in the heap.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k)\), for the heap storing up to `k` points.
- **Strengths**: Efficient for large arrays where `k` is much smaller than `n`.
- **Weaknesses**: If `k` is very close to `n`, a full sorting approach might be more straightforward, though the heap approach still remains efficient.
- **Potential Improvements**: For cases where `k` is very large, a Quickselect-based approach could also work with an average \(O(n)\) time complexity.

This solution efficiently finds the `k` closest points to the origin using a max-heap to retain only the top `k` smallest distances.
