### UMPIRE Approach

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - Each rectangle has its bottom-left corner at `(0, 0)` and its top-right corner at `(li, hi)`.
  - For each point `(xj, yj)`, we need to determine how many rectangles contain this point. A rectangle contains a point if `0 <= xj <= li` and `0 <= yj <= hi`.
  - Given constraints imply that we need an efficient approach:
    - `rectangles.length` and `points.length` can each be as large as \(5 \times 10^4\).
    - Length values go up to \(10^9\), while height values go only up to 100.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    ```plaintext
    rectangles = [[2, 3], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
    points = [[1, 1], [2, 2], [3, 4]]
    Output: [3, 2, 1]
    ```
    Explanation:
    - For point `(1, 1)`, it’s contained in all 3 rectangles.
    - For point `(2, 2)`, it’s contained in 2 rectangles.
    - For point `(3, 4)`, it’s contained in 1 rectangle.

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Range search and counting problem with constraints on heights.
- **Pattern**:
  - **Binary Search** is suitable for efficiently counting rectangles for each point.
  - **Preprocessing by Height**: Given that heights are limited (1 to 100), we can group rectangles by height and sort them by length. This will allow us to quickly count rectangles that contain a given point using binary search.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
1. **Group Rectangles by Height**:
   - Since there are only 100 possible values for height, create an unordered map where each key is a height, and each value is a sorted list of lengths for rectangles with that height.

2. **Binary Search for Lengths**:
   - For each height, store the lengths in sorted order. For a given point `(xj, yj)`, if `yj` is within the height of a rectangle, use binary search to find how many rectangles have a length greater than or equal to `xj`.

3. **Compute Result for Each Point**:
   - For each point, iterate over heights from `yj` to the maximum height (100) and check how many rectangles of that height contain the point by performing a binary search on the list of lengths for that height.
   - Sum these counts for all relevant heights to get the total number of rectangles containing each point.

### Steps

1. **Preprocess Rectangles by Height**:
   - Use an unordered map to store a vector of lengths for each height.
   - Sort each vector of lengths.

2. **Binary Search Helper**:
   - Implement a helper function that returns the count of lengths that are greater than or equal to a given `xj` using `std::lower_bound`.

3. **Calculate Counts for Each Point**:
   - For each point `(xj, yj)`, iterate from `yj` up to 100.
   - For each height, use binary search to count lengths satisfying `li >= xj`.
   - Sum these counts and store them as the result for the point.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the C++ code implementing this solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countRectangles(vector<vector<int>>& rectangles, vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        // Step 1: Group rectangles by height in a map
        unordered_map<int, vector<int>> heightToLengths;
        for (const auto& rect : rectangles) {
            int length = rect[0];
            int height = rect[1];
            heightToLengths[height].push_back(length);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Sort lengths for each height
        for (auto& [height, lengths] : heightToLengths) {
            sort(lengths.begin(), lengths.end());
        }
        
        // Step 3: Prepare result vector
        vector<int> result(points.size(), 0);
        
        // Step 4: Process each point
        for (int j = 0; j < points.size(); ++j) {
            int xj = points[j][0];
            int yj = points[j][1];
            
            int count = 0;
            // Step 5: Check rectangles for each height >= yj
            for (int h = yj; h <= 100; ++h) {
                if (heightToLengths.find(h) != heightToLengths.end()) {
                    const vector<int>& lengths = heightToLengths[h];
                    // Step 6: Use binary search to find count of lengths >= xj
                    count += lengths.end() - lower_bound(lengths.begin(), lengths.end(), xj);
                }
            }
            result[j] = count;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Group Rectangles by Height**:
   - `heightToLengths` is an unordered map where each key is a height, and each value is a vector of lengths of rectangles with that height.
   - We populate `heightToLengths` by iterating through each rectangle.

2. **Sort Lengths for Binary Search**:
   - For each height in the map, sort the vector of lengths so we can use binary search on it.

3. **Binary Search for Each Point**:
   - For each point `(xj, yj)`, iterate over heights starting from `yj` up to the maximum height (100).
   - For each valid height, use `std::lower_bound` to count the lengths that are greater than or equal to `xj` and add them to `count`.
   - Store `count` as the result for the current point.

4. **Return the Results**:
   - After processing all points, return the result vector.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Preprocessing**: \(O(R)\), where \(R\) is the number of rectangles, to group rectangles by height.
  - **Sorting**: \(O(R \log R)\) to sort the lengths within each height group.
  - **Query Processing**: For each point, we iterate from `yj` up to 100 (maximum height), and each binary search takes \(O(\log R)\). Given `P` points, the total complexity is approximately \(O(P \cdot 100 \cdot \log R)\).
  
  Overall complexity: \(O(R \log R + P \cdot \log R)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(R + P)\), to store the heights map and results for each point.

This approach leverages binary search and height constraints to avoid excessive comparisons, making it efficient enough to handle the problem's constraints.
