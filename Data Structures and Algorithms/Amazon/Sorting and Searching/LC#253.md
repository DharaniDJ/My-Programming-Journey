### Problem Statement

We’re given an array of intervals, where each interval represents a meeting’s start and end times. We need to determine the minimum number of conference rooms required to hold all meetings without any overlap.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - Each interval `[start, end]` represents a meeting that starts at `start` and ends at `end`.
  - Meetings can overlap, and if they do, we need additional rooms for each overlap.
  - We need the minimum number of rooms that can handle all the meetings without conflicts.
  
- **Edge Cases**:
  - No meetings at all (`intervals` is empty) should return `0` rooms.
  - All meetings are consecutive without overlap (only 1 room is needed).
  - All meetings overlap, requiring as many rooms as there are meetings.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `intervals = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]` → Output: `2`
  - **Example 2**: `intervals = [[7, 10], [2, 4]]` → Output: `1`
  - **Example 3**: `intervals = [[1, 5], [5, 10], [10, 15]]` → Output: `1` (consecutive meetings)

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Scheduling with intervals and overlap counting.
- **Pattern**: To efficiently determine the minimum rooms needed, we can separate the start and end times of all meetings and process them in a sorted order.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To schedule the meetings efficiently, it makes sense to process them in increasing order of their start times. We’ll allocate rooms for the earliest meetings first, just as we would assign a room to a 9 a.m. meeting before worrying about a 5 p.m. one. This strategy will help us handle room allocation in an organized way, minimizing the total rooms required.

1. **Separate and Sort Start and End Times**:
   - Extract all start times and end times from the intervals.
   - Sort both start and end times independently. This way, we can process the start of each meeting in the correct order and keep track of when each room becomes free.

2. **Use Two Pointers to Track Room Allocation**:
   - Initialize two pointers, one for the sorted start times (`i`) and one for the sorted end times (`j`).
   - Initialize a variable `rooms` to track the number of rooms currently in use and a variable `maxRooms` to store the maximum number of rooms needed.
   
3. **Iterate Over the Meetings Using Start and End Pointers**:
   - For each meeting:
     - If the start time of the current meeting is less than the end time of the earliest ending meeting (i.e., `start[i] < end[j]`), increment `rooms` because a new room is needed. Move the start pointer `i` to the next meeting.
     - If the start time is equal to or greater than the end time of the earliest ending meeting (`start[i] >= end[j]`), decrement `rooms` by moving the end pointer `j` to the next meeting (a room is now free).
     - Update `maxRooms` to be the maximum of `rooms` and `maxRooms`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - The value of `maxRooms` will represent the minimum number of conference rooms needed.

This approach ensures we only allocate rooms when necessary and release them as soon as possible, achieving an efficient \(O(n \log n)\) solution.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ implementation of this plan:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int minMeetingRooms(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
    if (intervals.empty()) return 0;
    
    // Separate and sort the start and end times
    vector<int> startTimes;
    vector<int> endTimes;
    
    for (const auto& interval : intervals) {
        startTimes.push_back(interval[0]);
        endTimes.push_back(interval[1]);
    }
    
    sort(startTimes.begin(), startTimes.end());
    sort(endTimes.begin(), endTimes.end());
    
    int rooms = 0;       // Rooms currently in use
    int maxRooms = 0;     // Minimum required rooms
    int i = 0, j = 0;     // Pointers for start and end times
    
    // Process each meeting's start time
    while (i < startTimes.size()) {
        if (startTimes[i] < endTimes[j]) {
            // Need an additional room
            rooms++;
            i++;
        } else {
            // Release a room
            rooms--;
            j++;
        }
        // Track the maximum number of rooms needed
        maxRooms = max(maxRooms, rooms);
    }
    
    return maxRooms;
}
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - For `intervals = [[0, 30], [5, 10], [15, 20]]`:
    - Start times: `[0, 5, 15]`
    - End times: `[10, 20, 30]`
    - Process each start and end time, updating `rooms` as needed. The algorithm correctly finds that `2` rooms are required.
  - For `intervals = [[7, 10], [2, 4]]`:
    - Start times: `[2, 7]`
    - End times: `[4, 10]`
    - The algorithm finds that only `1` room is required as the meetings do not overlap.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - An empty `intervals` list returns `0` rooms.
  - Consecutive meetings without overlap correctly return `1` room.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of meetings. Sorting both the start and end times takes \(O(n \log n)\), and the two-pointer traversal takes \(O(n)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), due to the additional storage required for the start and end times arrays.
- **Strengths**: Efficient and straightforward, leveraging sorted start and end times to minimize room allocation dynamically.
- **Weaknesses**: The solution requires additional storage for the start and end arrays.
- **Potential Improvements**: This solution is optimal for the problem constraints.

This solution efficiently determines the minimum rooms needed by processing meeting start and end times in a sorted manner, ensuring minimal room usage with \(O(n \log n)\) complexity.

            maxOverlaps = max(maxOverlaps, currentOverlaps);
            i++;
        } else {
            // A meeting ends before the next one starts
            currentOverlaps--;
