### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, we need to find the `k`th largest element in the array. We aim to solve this without fully sorting the array, focusing only on finding the `k`th largest element.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - We need the `k`th largest element in the array, meaning if the array were sorted in descending order, it would be the element at position `k - 1`.
  - The elements may contain duplicates, so we're looking for the `k`th largest value, not the `k`th distinct value.
  
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Array with one element (in this case, `k` must be 1).
  - Small arrays where `k` is close to the length of the array.
  - Cases where all elements are the same.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**: `nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4]`, `k = 2` → Output: `5` (2nd largest element)
  - **Example 2**: `nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6]`, `k = 4` → Output: `4` (4th largest element)
  - **Example 3**: `nums = [1]`, `k = 1` → Output: `1`

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Selection problem.
- **Pattern**: Since sorting the array would be inefficient, we can use a min-heap to keep track of the `k` largest elements in \(O(n \log k)\) time. Another approach would be the Quickselect algorithm, which achieves \(O(n)\) on average.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
The goal is to find the `k`th largest element without fully sorting the array. We can use a **min-heap** of size `k` to store the largest `k` elements as we traverse the array. The heap will allow us to efficiently maintain the `k` largest elements, with the smallest element in the heap representing the `k`th largest element in the array.

1. **Initialize a Min-Heap of Size k**:
   - Create a min-heap (priority queue) to store the `k` largest elements encountered so far. Using a min-heap lets us quickly identify the smallest of the largest `k` elements.

2. **Iterate Over the Array**:
   - For each element in `nums`:
     - If the heap size is less than `k`, add the element to the heap.
     - If the heap already has `k` elements, check if the current element is larger than the smallest element in the heap. If it is, replace the smallest element in the heap with the current element.
   - This way, the heap will always store the `k` largest elements, with the smallest element in the heap being the `k`th largest element in the array.

3. **Extract the Result**:
   - After processing all elements, the root of the heap (the smallest element) will be the `k`th largest element in the array.

This approach is efficient as it only keeps the top `k` elements in the heap, yielding an \(O(n \log k)\) time complexity.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ implementation of this approach:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    // Min-heap to keep track of the k largest elements
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;

    for (int num : nums) {
        // Add the current number to the heap
        minHeap.push(num);
        
        // If the heap size exceeds k, remove the smallest element
        if (minHeap.size() > k) {
            minHeap.pop();
        }
    }

    // The root of the heap is the kth largest element
    return minHeap.top();
}
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - For `nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4]` and `k = 2`:
    - Initialize the min-heap and add elements up to `k` size.
    - The heap maintains the two largest elements `[5, 6]`, with the root `5` as the 2nd largest element.
    - Return `5`.
  - For `nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6]` and `k = 4`:
    - The heap keeps the four largest elements `[4, 5, 5, 6]`, with `4` as the 4th largest.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - A single-element array, like `nums = [1]` with `k = 1`, correctly returns `1`.
  - Cases with repeated numbers, such as `nums = [2,2,2,2,2]` and `k = 3`, also work as expected since the algorithm only tracks the top `k` largest values.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log k)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `nums` and \(k\) is the size of the heap. We iterate over `nums`, and each insertion into the heap takes \(O(\log k)\) time.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k)\), for the min-heap that stores up to `k` elements.
- **Strengths**: Efficient for large arrays where \(k\) is small relative to \(n\).
- **Weaknesses**: If \(k\) is very close to \(n\), this approach may not be optimal compared to sorting.
- **Potential Improvements**: For cases where \(k\) is very large, Quickselect can provide an average \(O(n)\) solution.

This solution efficiently tracks the `k` largest elements in the array using a min-heap, achieving the desired time complexity without needing to sort the array.

### Next Step: Implementing Quickselect

If you’re expected to implement Quickselect, here’s a quick overview of the approach:

1. **Partitioning the Array**: Choose a pivot, partition the array so that elements greater than the pivot are on one side and elements less than the pivot are on the other.
2. **Recursive Search**: Check the position of the pivoted element relative to `k`. If it’s at the `k`th position, we’ve found our answer. Otherwise, recurse into the left or right partition.
3. **Average Case Efficiency**: Quickselect has an average time complexity of \(O(n)\) due to its selective sorting, making it efficient for finding the `k`th largest element. 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findKthLargest(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        return quickSelect(nums, k);
    }

    int quickSelect(vector<int> nums, int k){
        int pivot = nums[rand() % nums.size()];

        vector<int> left;
        vector<int> mid;
        vector<int> right;

        for(int num : nums){
            if(num > pivot) left.push_back(num);
            else if(num < pivot) right.push_back(num);
            else mid.push_back(num);
        }

        if(k<=left.size()) return quickSelect(left, k);
        if(left.size()+mid.size() < k) return quickSelect(mid, k-left.size()-mid.size());
        return pivot;
    }
};
```
