### UMPIRE Approach

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - We are asked to return the level order traversal of a binary tree, but with an alternating (zigzag) pattern:
    - For the first level, nodes are visited from left to right.
    - For the second level, nodes are visited from right to left.
    - This alternation continues for each subsequent level.
  - This requires us to reverse the order of traversal at every other level.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    - Input: `[3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]`
    - Output: `[[3], [20, 9], [15, 7]]`
  - **Example 2**:
    - Input: `[1]`
    - Output: `[[1]]`
  - **Example 3**:
    - Input: `[]` (empty tree)
    - Output: `[]`

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Binary tree traversal with specific order and alternation.
- **Pattern**: This is similar to **level order traversal (BFS)** but with an added condition to reverse the traversal direction at each level. We can use a queue to manage level order traversal and a flag to keep track of the direction.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
Using a queue, we can process nodes level by level. For each level:
1. Track the number of nodes at the current level.
2. Store the nodes' values for that level in a temporary list.
3. If the current level is even, append values left-to-right; if odd, append values right-to-left.
4. Flip the traversal direction for the next level.

### Steps

1. **Initialize a Queue**:
   - Start by adding the root node to the queue if it is not `null`.
   - Use a boolean flag `leftToRight` to track the current direction.

2. **Process Each Level**:
   - For each level, record the number of nodes currently in the queue.
   - Initialize an empty list for the current level’s values.
   - Dequeue each node at the current level:
     - If `leftToRight` is `true`, add each node’s value to the end of the list.
     - If `leftToRight` is `false`, insert each node’s value at the beginning of the list.
   - After processing all nodes at the current level, add the list of values for this level to the result list.
   - Toggle `leftToRight` to reverse the order for the next level.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Once the queue is empty, all levels have been processed, and we return the result list containing the zigzag traversal values.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the C++ code implementing the zigzag level order traversal:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <deque>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        if (!root) return result; // Return an empty result if the tree is empty

        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        bool leftToRight = true;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int levelSize = q.size(); // Number of nodes at the current level
            deque<int> levelValues; // Use deque to efficiently insert at both ends

            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();

                if (leftToRight) {
                    levelValues.push_back(node->val); // Insert at the end
                } else {
                    levelValues.push_front(node->val); // Insert at the beginning
                }

                // Enqueue the left and right children of the current node
                if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
            }

            // Convert deque to vector for the current level and add to result
            result.push_back(vector<int>(levelValues.begin(), levelValues.end()));
            
            // Toggle the direction for the next level
            leftToRight = !leftToRight;
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Queue Initialization**:
   - Start by adding the root node to the queue if it exists.
   - Use a `leftToRight` boolean to track the direction of traversal at each level.

2. **Level-by-Level Processing**:
   - For each level, use a `deque` named `levelValues` to store values at the current level.
     - If `leftToRight` is `true`, add each node’s value to the end of `levelValues`.
     - If `leftToRight` is `false`, add each node’s value to the front of `levelValues`, achieving the reverse order.
   - After processing all nodes at this level, convert `levelValues` to a vector and add it to the `result`.
   - Toggle `leftToRight` to alternate the direction for the next level.

3. **Result**:
   - Continue this process until the queue is empty.
   - Finally, return the `result`, which contains all levels in zigzag order.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - Each node is visited exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - In the worst case, the queue can hold up to the number of nodes at the widest level of the tree, which is proportional to \(n\) in a complete binary tree.

This solution efficiently performs a zigzag level order traversal of the binary tree by processing nodes level by level, using a deque to allow efficient insertion at both ends depending on the direction.
