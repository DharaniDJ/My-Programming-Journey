### Problem Statement

Given:
- The `root` of a binary tree.

The task:
- Return the **diameter** of the binary tree, defined as the longest path between any two nodes.
- The length of the path between two nodes is the number of edges in the path.

### Approach

To calculate the diameter:
1. For each node in the tree, the longest path (diameter) that goes through that node is the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees.
2. The diameter of the tree is the maximum diameter found at any node in the tree.

### Steps

1. **Recursive Function to Compute Height and Diameter**:
   - Define a helper function that, for each node, calculates the height of the subtree rooted at that node.
   - While computing the height, also calculate the diameter by taking the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees.
2. **Update Maximum Diameter**:
   - Maintain a variable `maxDiameter` to keep track of the longest path found.
   - For each node, update `maxDiameter` with the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees if this sum is greater than the current `maxDiameter`.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - After traversing all nodes, `maxDiameter` will contain the longest path (diameter) in the tree.

### Implementation in C++

Hereâ€™s the C++ code implementing the solution using a recursive approach:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int maxDiameter = 0;
        height(root, maxDiameter);
        return maxDiameter;
    }

private:
    // Recursive function to compute height and update the diameter
    int height(TreeNode* node, int& maxDiameter) {
        if (node == nullptr) return 0;

        // Compute the height of the left and right subtrees
        int leftHeight = height(node->left, maxDiameter);
        int rightHeight = height(node->right, maxDiameter);

        // Update the diameter for the current node
        maxDiameter = max(maxDiameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);

        // Return the height of the current node
        return 1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Height Function**:
   - This recursive function calculates the height of the subtree rooted at each node.
   - The height of a node is defined as `1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight)`.

2. **Diameter Calculation**:
   - For each node, calculate the **diameter passing through that node** as `leftHeight + rightHeight`.
   - Update `maxDiameter` if this value is larger than the current `maxDiameter`.

3. **Return the Diameter**:
   - The `diameterOfBinaryTree` function initializes `maxDiameter` to `0`, calls the recursive function, and finally returns the value of `maxDiameter`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - We visit each node once to calculate its height and update the diameter.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree.
  - The recursive call stack will hold at most \(h\) calls, which is \(O(N)\) for a skewed tree and \(O(\log N)\) for a balanced tree.

This recursive approach is efficient and calculates the diameter by leveraging the relationship between height and diameter at each node, ensuring we find the longest path in the tree.
