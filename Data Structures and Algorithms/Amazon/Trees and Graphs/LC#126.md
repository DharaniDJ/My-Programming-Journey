### Problem Statement

Given:
- A `beginWord`, an `endWord`, and a list of words `wordList`.
- The objective is to find all shortest transformation sequences from `beginWord` to `endWord`.
- Each word in the transformation sequence must differ by only one letter from the previous word, and every word in the sequence must exist in `wordList`.

Return:
- All sequences with the shortest transformation path from `beginWord` to `endWord`.
- Return an empty list if no such path exists.

### UMPIRE Approach

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - Each transformation changes exactly one letter.
  - All intermediate transformations must be valid words in `wordList`.
  - We need to find all shortest paths (multiple sequences if they exist).
  
- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    - Input: `beginWord = "hit"`, `endWord = "cog"`, `wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]`
    - Output: `[["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"], ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]`
  - **Example 2**:
    - Input: `beginWord = "hit"`, `endWord = "cog"`, `wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]`
    - Output: `[]` (no transformation to "cog" exists)

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Shortest path problem in an implicit graph.
- **Pattern**:
  - **BFS** is useful to find the shortest paths from `beginWord` to `endWord`.
  - **Backtracking** can be used to build all paths once the shortest path lengths are known.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
1. **BFS to Determine Path Lengths**:
   - Use BFS to explore the word graph and determine the shortest path distance from `beginWord` to each word.
   - Keep track of parents (predecessor nodes) of each word, so we can later reconstruct paths in reverse.

2. **Backtracking to Retrieve Paths**:
   - Starting from `endWord`, use the predecessor information to backtrack and construct all valid paths that reach `beginWord`.

### Steps

1. **Convert Word List to Set**:
   - Convert `wordList` into a set for `O(1)` lookups.
   - If `endWord` is not in the set, return `[]` immediately.

2. **Initialize BFS**:
   - Use BFS to explore the shortest paths and track parent relationships.
   - For each word, store the shortest distance from `beginWord` and maintain parent information.

3. **Run BFS to Build Graph**:
   - For each word in the BFS queue, try all single-letter transformations.
   - If a transformation exists in `wordSet`, update the shortest distance and parent information if this transformation hasn’t been reached yet or has been reached in the same number of steps (shortest path).
   - Continue until all shortest paths are discovered.

4. **Backtracking to Retrieve Paths**:
   - Starting from `endWord`, use backtracking with the parent information to generate all shortest transformation sequences.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the C++ code implementing this approach:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<string>> findLadders(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
        unordered_set<string> wordSet(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
        vector<vector<string>> result;

        // If endWord is not in wordSet, no solution exists
        if (wordSet.find(endWord) == wordSet.end()) return result;

        // BFS to build shortest path tree
        unordered_map<string, int> distances;
        unordered_map<string, vector<string>> parents;
        queue<string> q;

        distances[beginWord] = 0;
        q.push(beginWord);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            string currentWord = q.front();
            q.pop();
            int currentDist = distances[currentWord];

            // Generate all possible one-letter transformations
            for (int i = 0; i < currentWord.size(); ++i) {
                string nextWord = currentWord;

                for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
                    nextWord[i] = c;

                    if (nextWord == currentWord || wordSet.find(nextWord) == wordSet.end()) {
                        continue;
                    }

                    // If we encounter the next word for the first time, set its distance and add to queue
                    if (distances.find(nextWord) == distances.end()) {
                        distances[nextWord] = currentDist + 1;
                        q.push(nextWord);
                        parents[nextWord].push_back(currentWord); // Add currentWord as parent of nextWord
                    }
                    // If nextWord has been reached in the same number of steps, it is part of the shortest path tree
                    else if (distances[nextWord] == currentDist + 1) {
                        parents[nextWord].push_back(currentWord);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // If endWord is not reachable, return empty result
        if (distances.find(endWord) == distances.end()) return result;

        // Backtrack to find all paths from endWord to beginWord
        vector<string> path;
        backtrack(result, path, parents, endWord, beginWord);
        return result;
    }

private:
    void backtrack(vector<vector<string>>& result, vector<string>& path,
                   unordered_map<string, vector<string>>& parents, 
                   string word, string& beginWord) {
        path.push_back(word);
        
        if (word == beginWord) {
            vector<string> tempPath = path;
            reverse(tempPath.begin(), tempPath.end());
            result.push_back(tempPath);
        } else {
            for (const string& parent : parents[word]) {
                backtrack(result, path, parents, parent, beginWord);
            }
        }

        path.pop_back(); // Remove word to backtrack to previous level
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **BFS Traversal**:
   - The BFS builds the shortest path tree using `distances` to store the minimum distance from `beginWord` and `parents` to track each word’s predecessors.
   - For each word in the queue, generate all one-letter transformations, and update the `distances` and `parents` if a shorter or equal distance path is found.

2. **Backtracking Function**:
   - Starting from `endWord`, backtrack to `beginWord` using the `parents` map.
   - Each time `beginWord` is reached, the current path is reversed and added to `result`.
   - The function removes the last word in the path after each recursive call to ensure that each path is explored independently.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(M * N)\), where:
  - \(M\) is the length of each word.
  - \(N\) is the total number of words in `wordList`.
  - Each word can have up to \(26 * M\) neighbors, and the BFS processes each word once.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N * M)\), for storing the graph and parent relations.

This solution finds all shortest paths by using BFS to construct a shortest path tree and backtracking to retrieve all possible paths from `beginWord` to `endWord`. The use of BFS ensures that only the shortest paths are stored, and backtracking allows us to collect all valid transformation sequences.
