### Problem Statement

- You have `numCourses` courses labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`.
- Each course may have prerequisites, represented as pairs in `prerequisites`.
- To finish all courses, you must be able to take them in some order that respects all prerequisites.
- If it’s possible to take all courses, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Approach

This is a **cycle detection problem** in a directed graph:
- Each course is a node.
- A prerequisite relationship `[a, b]` means there is a directed edge from `b` to `a`.
- If there’s a cycle in this graph, it’s impossible to finish all courses (as some courses would depend on each other in a circular way).

Two primary methods to detect cycles in a directed graph are **DFS with recursion** and **Kahn’s Algorithm (Topological Sort using BFS)**.

### Solution Using Kahn’s Algorithm (BFS Topological Sort)

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Represent the courses as nodes in a directed graph.
   - Each course with a prerequisite has a directed edge pointing from the prerequisite to the course.
   
2. **In-Degree Array**:
   - Maintain an in-degree count for each course.
   - The in-degree of a node (course) is the number of prerequisites for that course.
   
3. **Initialize the Queue**:
   - Add all courses with an in-degree of `0` (courses that have no prerequisites) to a queue. These courses can be taken initially.
   
4. **BFS Traversal**:
   - Process each course from the queue, and for each course, reduce the in-degree of its neighbors by `1` (indicating that we’ve “taken” this prerequisite).
   - If any neighboring course’s in-degree becomes `0`, add it to the queue.
   
5. **Check if All Courses Can Be Completed**:
   - Keep track of the number of courses we’ve been able to process.
   - If we’ve processed all courses, it means we can take them all in a valid order. If not, there’s a cycle, and it’s impossible to complete all courses.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the code implementing the solution using Kahn’s Algorithm (Topological Sort with BFS):

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(numCourses);
        vector<int> inDegree(numCourses, 0);
        
        // Build the graph and in-degree array
        for (const auto& prerequisite : prerequisites) {
            int course = prerequisite[0];
            int pre = prerequisite[1];
            graph[pre].push_back(course);
            inDegree[course]++;
        }
        
        // Queue to store courses with in-degree of 0
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; ++i) {
            if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0; // Count of courses we can complete
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int course = q.front();
            q.pop();
            count++;
            
            // Reduce the in-degree of the neighbors (dependent courses)
            for (int nextCourse : graph[course]) {
                inDegree[nextCourse]--;
                if (inDegree[nextCourse] == 0) {
                    q.push(nextCourse);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If we were able to process all courses, we can complete them
        return count == numCourses;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - We build an adjacency list to represent the graph and an in-degree array to track prerequisites for each course.

2. **Queue Initialization**:
   - All courses with no prerequisites (in-degree `0`) are added to the queue initially, as they can be taken immediately.

3. **BFS Process**:
   - We process each course in the queue:
     - Decrease the in-degree of each neighboring course.
     - If any neighboring course’s in-degree becomes `0`, add it to the queue (indicating it can now be taken).
   - For each course processed, we increment `count`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - If `count` equals `numCourses`, it means we’ve been able to process all courses, and thus, we can complete them.
   - If `count` is less than `numCourses`, there’s a cycle, and some courses are unreachable, so we return `false`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of courses (nodes) and \(E\) is the number of prerequisites (edges).
  - We build the graph in \(O(E)\) time.
  - The BFS traversal of all nodes and edges takes \(O(V + E)\) time.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(V + E)\):
  - The adjacency list uses \(O(V + E)\) space.
  - The in-degree array and queue use \(O(V)\) space.

### Alternative Approach: DFS with Cycle Detection

An alternative solution is to use DFS to detect cycles in the graph:
- Use a recursive DFS and mark each node’s state as:
  - Unvisited (`0`)
  - Visiting (`1`) — currently in the call stack
  - Visited (`2`)
- If we revisit a `Visiting` node, there’s a cycle.
- This approach would also yield an \(O(V + E)\) time complexity and can be implemented similarly.

Using BFS with Kahn’s Algorithm is typically more straightforward for topological sorting problems and provides an intuitive solution for checking course prerequisites.
