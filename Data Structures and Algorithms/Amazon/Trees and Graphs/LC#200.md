### Problem Statement

Given:
- An `m x n` binary grid where:
  - `'1'` represents land.
  - `'0'` represents water.
  
The task:
- Return the number of islands, where an island is a contiguous group of `'1'`s connected horizontally or vertically.

### UMPIRE Approach

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - We need to identify clusters of connected land cells (`'1'`).
  - An island is surrounded by water (`'0'`), and only horizontally or vertically adjacent cells are part of the same island.
  - The edges of the grid are assumed to be surrounded by water.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    - Input: `grid = [["1","1","1","1","0"],["1","1","0","1","0"],["1","1","0","0","0"],["0","0","0","0","0"]]`
    - Output: `1`
  - **Example 2**:
    - Input: `grid = [["1","1","0","0","0"],["1","1","0","0","0"],["0","0","1","0","0"],["0","0","0","1","1"]]`
    - Output: `3`

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Graph traversal problem on a grid.
- **Pattern**:
  - Each cell can be thought of as a node, and each adjacent land cell as an edge to the neighboring node.
  - DFS or BFS is appropriate to explore and mark connected components.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To count the number of islands:
1. We iterate through each cell in the grid.
2. Each time we encounter a cell with a `'1'`, it indicates the start of a new island.
3. We then use DFS or BFS to traverse all connected land cells from this starting cell, marking each visited cell as water (`'0'`) to avoid revisiting.
4. Each DFS/BFS completes a traversal of one island, so we increment the island count.
5. Continue until all cells have been processed.

### Steps

1. **Initialize Island Count**:
   - Set `numIslands` to 0.
   
2. **Iterate Through the Grid**:
   - For each cell, if the cell is a `'1'`, start a DFS/BFS to mark the entire island and increment the `numIslands` counter.

3. **DFS/BFS to Mark the Island**:
   - For each cell in the island, mark it as `'0'` to prevent revisiting.
   - Use DFS or BFS to recursively or iteratively visit all four directions (up, down, left, right).
   
4. **Return the Count of Islands**:
   - Once the traversal is complete for all cells, return `numIslands`.

### Implementation in C++ (Using DFS)

Here’s the C++ code implementing this approach with DFS:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int numIslands = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') { // Found an island
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                    ++numIslands; // Increment the count after exploring an island
                }
            }
        }
        
        return numIslands;
    }

private:
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
        // Check if out of bounds or at a water cell
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] == '0') {
            return;
        }
        
        // Mark the cell as visited
        grid[i][j] = '0';
        
        // Explore all four directions
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j); // Down
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j); // Up
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1); // Right
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1); // Left
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Outer Loop**:
   - We iterate through every cell in the grid.
   - If we find a cell with `'1'`, it means we’ve found an unvisited island.
   
2. **DFS Function**:
   - This function marks all connected `'1'` cells as visited by changing them to `'0'`.
   - It recursively explores all four directions to traverse the entire island.
   
3. **Increment Island Count**:
   - After finishing the DFS for each new island, increment `numIslands`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m * n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns in the grid.
  - Every cell is visited once.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m * n)\) for the recursion stack in the worst case (if the grid is completely filled with land, making a single large island).

### Alternative: BFS Implementation

If you prefer BFS, here’s the BFS version of the solution:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int numIslands = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    bfs(grid, i, j);
                    ++numIslands;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return numIslands;
    }

private:
    void bfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({i, j});
        grid[i][j] = '0'; // Mark as visited
        
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [x, y] = q.front();
            q.pop();
            
            // Explore all four directions
            for (auto [dx, dy] : directions) {
                int nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;
                if (nx >= 0 && nx < grid.size() && ny >= 0 && ny < grid[0].size() && grid[nx][ny] == '1') {
                    q.push({nx, ny});
                    grid[nx][ny] = '0'; // Mark as visited
                }
            }
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the BFS Code

1. **BFS Initialization**:
   - For each new island (cell with `'1'`), start a BFS by enqueuing its coordinates.
   
2. **Processing the Queue**:
   - For each cell, mark it as visited and enqueue all valid, adjacent land cells (`'1'`).
   
3. **Direction Array**:
   - Use a direction array to easily explore all four directions (down, up, right, left).

### Complexity Analysis for BFS

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m * n)\), as we visit each cell once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(\min(m, n))\), for the queue size in the worst case.

Both DFS and BFS efficiently count the islands by exploring connected land cells in each island cluster. The BFS and DFS methods yield the same result, with BFS using a queue and DFS using recursion.
