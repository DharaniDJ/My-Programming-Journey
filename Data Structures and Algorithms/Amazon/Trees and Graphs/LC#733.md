Certainly! Let's go through the UMPIRE approach for the flood fill problem.

### UMPIRE Approach

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - You are given a starting pixel `(sr, sc)` and a target `color`.
  - The goal is to change the color of the starting pixel and all connected (horizontally or vertically adjacent) pixels that share the same original color as `(sr, sc)` to the new `color`.
  - The operation should stop when there are no more adjacent pixels with the original color to update.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    ```plaintext
    Input: image = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
    Output: [[2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1]]
    Explanation: All connected cells with the original color are updated.
    ```
  - **Example 2**:
    ```plaintext
    Input: image = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 1
    Output: [[0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 1]]
    Explanation: The starting pixel already has the target color, so no change is needed.
    ```

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Connected component exploration in a grid.
- **Pattern**:
  - This is similar to a graph traversal problem, where each cell in the grid can be thought of as a node.
  - **DFS (Depth-First Search)** or **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** are suitable approaches for exploring all connected nodes (pixels) with the same color, and updating them.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
We start from the given `(sr, sc)` position in the grid and use DFS or BFS to update all connected pixels of the same color as the starting pixel. This ensures we only update the desired region of the image.

### Steps

1. **Check for Early Exit**:
   - If the starting pixel already has the target `color`, no changes are needed. Return the image as is.

2. **Define Recursive DFS or Iterative BFS**:
   - We use either DFS or BFS to explore all pixels connected to `(sr, sc)` that have the same original color.
   - Change each visited pixel’s color to the new `color`.

3. **DFS/BFS Implementation**:
   - **DFS (Recursive)**:
     - Start from `(sr, sc)`, update it to `color`, and recursively explore all four directions (up, down, left, right).
   - **BFS (Iterative)**:
     - Initialize a queue starting from `(sr, sc)`, and use BFS to explore all adjacent pixels with the original color, updating them to the new `color`.

4. **Return Modified Image**:
   - After all reachable connected pixels are updated, return the modified image.

### Implementation in C++ (DFS and BFS)

Here’s the C++ code implementing the solution using both DFS and BFS approaches.

### Solution 1: DFS Approach

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> floodFill(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int color) {
        int originalColor = image[sr][sc];
        if (originalColor != color) { // Avoid unnecessary processing
            dfs(image, sr, sc, originalColor, color);
        }
        return image;
    }

private:
    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& image, int x, int y, int originalColor, int color) {
        // Check boundaries and ensure current cell matches the original color
        if (x < 0 || x >= image.size() || y < 0 || y >= image[0].size() || image[x][y] != originalColor) {
            return;
        }

        // Update the current pixel's color
        image[x][y] = color;

        // Recursively apply flood fill to all four adjacent cells
        dfs(image, x + 1, y, originalColor, color); // down
        dfs(image, x - 1, y, originalColor, color); // up
        dfs(image, x, y + 1, originalColor, color); // right
        dfs(image, x, y - 1, originalColor, color); // left
    }
};
```

### Solution 2: BFS Approach

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> floodFill(vector<vector<int>>& image, int sr, int sc, int color) {
        int originalColor = image[sr][sc];
        if (originalColor == color) return image; // Early exit if the color is already the target color

        int m = image.size();
        int n = image[0].size();
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({sr, sc});
        image[sr][sc] = color;

        // Directions for moving up, down, left, and right
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
        
        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [x, y] = q.front();
            q.pop();

            for (const auto& d : directions) {
                int nx = x + d.first;
                int ny = y + d.second;

                // Check boundaries and the original color
                if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && image[nx][ny] == originalColor) {
                    image[nx][ny] = color;
                    q.push({nx, ny});
                }
            }
        }

        return image;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Early Exit**:
   - If the starting pixel already has the target `color`, there’s no need to process further, and we can return the image directly.

2. **DFS or BFS Flood Fill**:
   - **DFS (Recursive)**:
     - We recursively explore each adjacent pixel (up, down, left, right) and update it to the target `color` if it matches the original color.
     - The recursion stops when a pixel is out of bounds or doesn’t match the original color.
   - **BFS (Iterative)**:
     - Initialize a queue with the starting pixel.
     - For each pixel in the queue, we check adjacent pixels and update them if they match the original color.
     - This avoids deep recursion issues by iteratively exploring the connected region.

3. **Return Modified Image**:
   - After updating all connected pixels, return the modified image.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m * n)\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the dimensions of the grid.
  - In the worst case, we may need to visit every pixel in the image.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - **DFS**: \(O(m * n)\) due to the recursion stack, especially if the connected component spans the entire grid.
  - **BFS**: \(O(m * n)\) for the queue in the worst case.

This approach efficiently fills connected regions of pixels with the specified color, exploring each pixel exactly once. Both DFS and BFS work effectively, with BFS typically preferred in languages with limited recursion depth.
