To solve the problem of validating a binary search tree (BST), let’s use the UMPIRE approach, and we’ll implement an iterative solution using inorder traversal.

---

### Problem Statement

Given:
- The `root` of a binary tree.

The task:
- Determine if the tree is a valid binary search tree (BST), where:
  - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node’s value.
  - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node’s value.
  - Both subtrees must also be valid binary search trees.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - In a valid BST, the values in the left subtree must always be less than the node, and values in the right subtree must be greater.
  - An inorder traversal of a valid BST should result in a strictly increasing sequence of values.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    - Input: `[2,1,3]`
    - Output: `true` (it’s a valid BST)
  - **Example 2**:
    - Input: `[5,1,4,null,null,3,6]`
    - Output: `false` (the right child `4` has a left child `3` that is less than `5`)

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Binary tree traversal with constraints.
- **Pattern**: To check if the tree is a BST, we can use **inorder traversal** (left-root-right) which, for a BST, should produce values in ascending order. If the traversal produces a non-increasing sequence at any point, we can conclude that the tree is not a valid BST.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
We’ll perform an inorder traversal iteratively, comparing each node with the previous one. If at any step the current node's value is not greater than the previous node's value, we know that the tree is not a valid BST.

### Steps

1. **Use a Stack for Inorder Traversal**:
   - We’ll use a stack to perform an iterative inorder traversal, pushing left nodes onto the stack until we reach the leftmost node.
  
2. **Maintain a Previous Node Value**:
   - Track the last visited node’s value (starting with `nullptr` for the first node).
   - For each visited node, check if its value is greater than the previous node’s value. If not, return `false` immediately.

3. **Inorder Traversal Logic**:
   - Pop a node from the stack and compare its value with the `prev` value.
   - Update `prev` to the current node’s value.
   - Move to the right subtree of the current node.

4. **Return `true` if Traversal Completes without Violations**:
   - If the traversal finishes and we’ve found no violations, the tree is a valid BST.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the C++ code implementing the iterative inorder traversal to validate the BST:

```cpp
#include <stack>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    bool isValidBST(TreeNode* root) {
        stack<TreeNode*> stk;
        TreeNode* current = root;
        TreeNode* prev = nullptr; // To keep track of the previous node in inorder traversal

        while (!stk.empty() || current != nullptr) {
            // Traverse the left subtree
            while (current != nullptr) {
                stk.push(current);
                current = current->left;
            }

            // Visit the node
            current = stk.top();
            stk.pop();

            // Check if the current node's value is greater than the previous node's value
            if (prev != nullptr && current->val <= prev->val) {
                return false; // If not, it's not a valid BST
            }

            // Update prev to the current node for the next comparison
            prev = current;

            // Traverse the right subtree
            current = current->right;
        }

        return true; // If we complete the traversal with no issues, it's a valid BST
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Stack Setup for Inorder Traversal**:
   - We use a stack to simulate recursion and move left until we reach the leftmost node.

2. **Inorder Traversal**:
   - After reaching the leftmost node, we pop from the stack to process each node.
   - We check that the current node’s value is greater than the `prev` node's value. If this condition is violated, we immediately return `false`.

3. **Updating `prev`**:
   - After checking, we update `prev` to the current node for future comparisons.
   - We then move to the right child of the current node and repeat the process.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - We visit each node exactly once during the inorder traversal.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree.
  - In the worst case (for a skewed tree), the stack may hold up to \(h\) nodes, which is \(O(n)\) for an unbalanced tree. For a balanced tree, this would be \(O(\log n)\).

This solution efficiently checks for the BST property by leveraging the sorted nature of inorder traversal in a BST, ensuring that each node is visited only once.
