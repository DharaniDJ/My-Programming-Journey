### UMPIRE Approach

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - We need to find the path with the highest possible sum of node values.
  - The path does not need to start or end at the root, and it can involve any sequence of connected nodes.
  - Each node in the tree could have a positive or negative value.
  
- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
    - Output: `6` (path: `[2, 1, 3]`)
  - **Example 2**:
    - Input: `[-10, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]`
    - Output: `42` (path: `[15, 20, 7]`)

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Binary tree traversal with dynamic programming concepts.
- **Pattern**: The maximum path sum can be calculated recursively by using a **post-order traversal**. This allows us to compute the path sum for the left and right subtrees before considering the root node itself.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
Using post-order traversal, we can compute the path sum gain contributed by the left and right subtrees for each node. We then determine whether to include these gains in the path sum calculation at the current node:
1. For each node, there are four possible path configurations:
   - The path starts from the node and goes down the left subtree.
   - The path starts from the node and goes down the right subtree.
   - The path involves both the left and right subtrees.
   - The path includes only the node itself.
2. We choose to include the left or right subtree in the path only if it contributes a positive gain.
3. Keep track of the global maximum path sum as we traverse the tree.
4. Return the maximum gain that can be achieved by continuing from the current node to its parent.

### Steps

1. **Define a Helper Function**:
   - Create a helper function `maxGain(node)` that performs a post-order traversal.
   - This function returns the maximum gain from a subtree rooted at `node`, considering paths that pass through `node`.
  
2. **Calculate the Maximum Path Sum at Each Node**:
   - For each node, compute the `leftGain` and `rightGain` as the maximum gain from the left and right subtrees, respectively.
   - Only consider positive gains; if a subtree path sum is negative, ignore it (set gain to 0).
   - Calculate the `currentPathSum` by considering the node value and both gains (`node->val + leftGain + rightGain`).
   - Update the global `maxSum` if `currentPathSum` is greater than the current `maxSum`.
  
3. **Return the Maximum Gain for the Current Node**:
   - The maximum gain for the parent node (if the path continues through this node) is `node->val + max(leftGain, rightGain)`.

4. **Initiate the Helper Function**:
   - Call `maxGain` on the root node and return the `maxSum`.

### Implementation in C++

Hereâ€™s the C++ code implementing the solution with post-order traversal and a helper function:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <limits.h>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
private:
    int maxSum; 
    
    int maxGain(TreeNode* node) {
        if (!node) return 0;
        
        int leftGain = max(maxGain(node->left), 0); // Ignore negative gains
        int rightGain = max(maxGain(node->right), 0); // Ignore negative gains
        
        // Path sum that passes through the node, using both left and right gains
        int currentPathSum = node->val + leftGain + rightGain;
        
        // Update the maximum path sum if currentPathSum is higher
        maxSum = max(maxSum, currentPathSum);
        
        // Return the maximum gain if the path continues from the current node to the parent
        return node->val + max(leftGain, rightGain);
    }

public:
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        maxSum = INT_MIN; // Initialize to minimum integer value
        maxGain(root); // Start post-order traversal from root
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Helper Function (`maxGain`)**:
   - Performs a post-order traversal to calculate the maximum gain for each subtree.
   - **Base Case**: If the node is `null`, it contributes `0` to the path.
   - For each non-`null` node:
     - Recursively compute the maximum gain from the left and right subtrees.
     - Ignore negative gains (use `max(..., 0)`).
     - Calculate the potential maximum path sum that passes through this node (`currentPathSum`).
     - Update `maxSum` if `currentPathSum` is the highest found so far.
   - Return the maximum gain achievable from this node to its parent (`node->val + max(leftGain, rightGain)`).

2. **Main Function (`maxPathSum`)**:
   - Initializes `maxSum` to a very low value (to accommodate trees with all negative values).
   - Calls `maxGain` starting at the root, and finally returns `maxSum`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - Each node is visited once in a post-order traversal, and each visit involves constant-time calculations.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree.
  - The recursive call stack depth will be equal to the height of the tree, which is \(O(n)\) for a skewed tree and \(O(\log n)\) for a balanced tree.

This solution efficiently finds the maximum path sum by computing the optimal path sum gains at each node, leveraging post-order traversal to ensure that we only process a node after its children have been processed. This allows us to dynamically track the maximum possible path sum as we move through the tree.
