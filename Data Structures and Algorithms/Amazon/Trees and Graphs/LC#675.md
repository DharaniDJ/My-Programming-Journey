### Problem Statement

You’re given a grid (matrix) that represents a forest:
- `0`: an obstacle that you cannot walk through.
- `1`: an empty cell you can walk through.
- A number greater than `1` represents a tree that you can walk through, and the number is the tree’s height.

Starting from the top-left corner `(0, 0)`, your task is to cut all trees in increasing order of their height. Cutting a tree turns the cell into an empty cell (`1`). You should minimize the total steps taken. If it’s impossible to reach all trees, return `-1`.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - You must cut trees in the order of their height (shortest to tallest).
  - You can move in four directions (north, south, east, and west) to reach each tree.
  - If any tree is unreachable, return `-1`.
  - Starting point is `(0, 0)`.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    ```plaintext
    Input: forest = [[1, 2, 3],
                     [0, 0, 4],
                     [7, 6, 5]]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: Cut trees in the order of their height.
    ```
  - **Example 2**:
    ```plaintext
    Input: forest = [[1, 2, 3],
                     [0, 0, 0],
                     [7, 6, 5]]
    Output: -1
    Explanation: It’s impossible to reach tree with height `7`.
    ```

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Shortest path calculation in a grid with obstacles.
- **Pattern**:
  - Use **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the shortest path between each pair of consecutive trees (in height order).
  - The BFS is suitable as it explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.
  - Sort trees by height to ensure we cut them in the correct order.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To cut the trees in increasing order of height with minimum steps:
1. Identify and sort all trees in the grid by their height.
2. Use BFS to find the shortest path from the current position to each tree in order.
3. Accumulate the steps for each move to a tree. If any tree is unreachable, return `-1`.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Extract and Sort Trees by Height**:
   - Traverse the grid and collect the coordinates and heights of all cells with a value greater than `1`.
   - Sort the list of trees by height.

2. **BFS Function to Find Shortest Path**:
   - Implement a BFS function that calculates the shortest path between two points on the grid.
   - The BFS function returns the minimum steps required or `-1` if the target is unreachable.

3. **Calculate Total Steps**:
   - Starting from `(0, 0)`, use BFS to find the shortest path to each tree in the sorted list.
   - Accumulate the steps required for each tree. After cutting each tree, treat it as an empty cell (`1`).
   - If any tree is unreachable, return `-1` immediately.

4. **Return Total Steps**:
   - After visiting all trees, return the total steps.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the C++ code implementing this approach using BFS and sorted traversal.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int cutOffTree(vector<vector<int>>& forest) {
        int m = forest.size();
        int n = forest[0].size();

        // Step 1: Extract all trees and sort them by height
        vector<pair<int, pair<int, int>>> trees;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (forest[i][j] > 1) { // Find all trees
                    trees.push_back({forest[i][j], {i, j}});
                }
            }
        }
        sort(trees.begin(), trees.end()); // Sort trees by height

        // Step 2: Calculate total steps required to cut each tree in order
        int totalSteps = 0;
        int startX = 0, startY = 0;

        for (const auto& tree : trees) {
            int targetX = tree.second.first;
            int targetY = tree.second.second;
            int steps = bfs(forest, startX, startY, targetX, targetY);

            // If the tree is unreachable, return -1
            if (steps == -1) return -1;

            totalSteps += steps;
            startX = targetX;
            startY = targetY;
        }

        return totalSteps;
    }

private:
    // BFS function to find the shortest path from (startX, startY) to (targetX, targetY)
    int bfs(vector<vector<int>>& forest, int startX, int startY, int targetX, int targetY) {
        if (startX == targetX && startY == targetY) return 0; // Already at the target

        int m = forest.size();
        int n = forest[0].size();
        vector<vector<bool>> visited(m, vector<bool>(n, false));
        queue<pair<int, int>> q;
        q.push({startX, startY});
        visited[startX][startY] = true;

        int steps = 0;
        vector<pair<int, int>> directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int qSize = q.size();
            ++steps;

            for (int i = 0; i < qSize; ++i) {
                auto [x, y] = q.front();
                q.pop();

                for (const auto& d : directions) {
                    int nx = x + d.first;
                    int ny = y + d.second;

                    // Check if the new position is within bounds and walkable
                    if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && !visited[nx][ny] && forest[nx][ny] != 0) {
                        if (nx == targetX && ny == targetY) return steps;
                        visited[nx][ny] = true;
                        q.push({nx, ny});
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return -1; // If the target is unreachable
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Extract and Sort Trees**:
   - We traverse the matrix, collect all tree positions with heights, and store them in `trees`.
   - Sorting `trees` ensures that we cut them in ascending order of height.

2. **BFS Function**:
   - A helper function `bfs` is implemented to find the shortest path from `(startX, startY)` to `(targetX, targetY)`.
   - The BFS function checks each neighboring cell to find the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
   - If a target tree is unreachable, it returns `-1`.

3. **Cutting Trees in Order**:
   - We iterate over the sorted list of trees.
   - For each tree, we calculate the shortest path using `bfs`, accumulate the steps, and update our starting position.

4. **Return Total Steps**:
   - If any tree is unreachable, we return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, we return the accumulated steps.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(T * m * n)\), where \(T\) is the number of trees. Each BFS to find a path between trees takes \(O(m * n)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m * n)\) for the BFS queue and visited array.

This approach efficiently finds the shortest path to each tree in the correct order, ensuring that we reach each tree with the minimum steps possible. If any tree is unreachable, it returns `-1` as required.
