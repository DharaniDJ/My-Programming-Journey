To find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree, we can use a **recursive depth-first search (DFS)** approach.

### Problem Statement

Given:
- A binary tree with nodes.
- Two nodes, `p` and `q`.

Task:
- Find the **lowest common ancestor (LCA)** of `p` and `q`.
- The LCA is the lowest node in the tree that has both `p` and `q` as descendants. A node can be a descendant of itself.

### Approach

Since it’s a binary tree (not necessarily a binary search tree), we’ll need to search both left and right subtrees to locate the nodes `p` and `q`.

### Intuition

1. **Recursive DFS Approach**:
   - For each node, check if it matches either `p` or `q`.
   - If it matches, return the node itself (because if one of the nodes is the ancestor of the other, that node is the LCA).
   - Recursively search for `p` and `q` in both the left and right subtrees.

2. **Identify the LCA**:
   - For any node in the tree:
     - If both `p` and `q` are found in its left and right subtrees, this node is the LCA.
     - If one of `p` or `q` is found in either the left or right subtree, continue returning that node up the recursion.
     - If both are in the same subtree, the search will continue until we find the LCA.

3. **Base Case**:
   - If we reach a `null` node, return `null`.
   - If we find either `p` or `q`, return that node up the recursion stack.

### Steps

1. **Check the Current Node**:
   - If the current node is `null`, return `null`.
   - If the current node is `p` or `q`, return it since one of the nodes is found.

2. **Recur on Left and Right Subtrees**:
   - Recursively search for `p` and `q` in both left and right subtrees.

3. **Determine the LCA**:
   - If both left and right recursive calls return non-null values, the current node is the LCA (as `p` and `q` are found in different subtrees).
   - If only one of the recursive calls returns a non-null value, return that value (indicating that both `p` and `q` are in the same subtree).
   
4. **Return the Result**:
   - Continue the recursive process until the LCA is identified.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the C++ code for the recursive approach:

```cpp
#include <cstddef>

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (root == nullptr || root == p || root == q) {
            return root;
        }
        
        // Search for nodes p and q in the left and right subtrees
        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
        
        // If both left and right are non-null, this is the LCA
        if (left != nullptr && right != nullptr) {
            return root;
        }
        
        // Otherwise, return the non-null child (indicating both nodes are in one subtree)
        return left != nullptr ? left : right;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Base Case**:
   - If `root` is `null`, return `null` (no LCA possible here).
   - If `root` matches `p` or `q`, return `root` (this is potentially the LCA if the other node is found in one of the subtrees).

2. **Recursive Search**:
   - Perform a recursive DFS search for `p` and `q` in both `left` and `right` subtrees of the current node.

3. **LCA Decision**:
   - If both `left` and `right` return non-null values, the current node is the LCA because `p` and `q` are found in different subtrees.
   - If only one of `left` or `right` is non-null, return the non-null subtree, indicating both `p` and `q` are in that subtree.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - In the worst case, we visit every node once.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree.
  - The recursive call stack will hold at most \(h\) calls, which is \(O(N)\) for a skewed tree and \(O(\log N)\) for a balanced tree.

This recursive approach is efficient and straightforward for identifying the lowest common ancestor in a binary tree, ensuring that we can handle cases where nodes `p` and `q` may be located anywhere in the tree.
