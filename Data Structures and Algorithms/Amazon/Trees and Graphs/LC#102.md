### UMPIRE Approach

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - In a level order traversal, we visit each level of the tree from top to bottom and from left to right within each level.
  - This requires us to visit each node level by level.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    - Input: `[3, 9, 20, null, null, 15, 7]`
    - Output: `[[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]`
  - **Example 2**:
    - Input: `[1]`
    - Output: `[[1]]`
  - **Example 3**:
    - Input: `[]` (empty tree)
    - Output: `[]`

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Binary tree traversal with specific order.
- **Pattern**: We can use a **breadth-first search (BFS)** approach using a queue to visit nodes level by level. For each level, we process all nodes currently in the queue, which represent the nodes at that specific level.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
Using a queue, we can keep track of nodes at each level. By iterating through the queue, we process each level in turn, adding all child nodes of the current level’s nodes to the queue for the next level’s processing.

### Steps

1. **Initialize a Queue**:
   - Start by adding the root node to the queue if it is not `null`.
   
2. **Process Each Level**:
   - For each level, record the number of nodes currently in the queue (this number represents the total nodes at that level).
   - Initialize an empty list for the current level’s values.
   - Dequeue each node at the current level:
     - Add the node’s value to the current level’s list.
     - If the node has left and right children, enqueue them.
   - After processing all nodes at the current level, add the list of values for this level to the result list.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Once the queue is empty, all levels have been processed, and we return the result list containing values for each level.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the C++ code implementing the iterative level order traversal:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        if (!root) return result; // Return an empty result if the tree is empty

        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int levelSize = q.size(); // Number of nodes at the current level
            vector<int> levelValues;

            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; ++i) {
                TreeNode* node = q.front();
                q.pop();
                levelValues.push_back(node->val);

                // Enqueue the left and right children of the current node
                if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
                if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
            }

            // Add the current level's values to the result
            result.push_back(levelValues);
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Queue Initialization**:
   - Start by adding the root node to the queue if it exists.

2. **Level-by-Level Processing**:
   - For each level, get the `levelSize` by checking the queue’s current size, which tells us how many nodes are at this level.
   - Initialize an empty list `levelValues` to store the values of the nodes at the current level.
   - For each node at this level:
     - Dequeue the node, add its value to `levelValues`.
     - If the node has left and right children, enqueue them for processing in the next level.
   - Once all nodes at this level are processed, add `levelValues` to the `result`.

3. **Result**:
   - Continue this process until the queue is empty.
   - Finally, return the `result`, which contains all levels in level order.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - Each node is visited exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the maximum number of nodes in the tree.
  - In the worst case, the queue can hold up to the number of nodes at the widest level of the tree, which is proportional to \(n\) in a complete binary tree.

This solution effectively performs a level order traversal of the binary tree by processing nodes level by level in a queue, ensuring that all nodes are visited in the desired order.
