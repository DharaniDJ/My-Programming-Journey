### UMPIRE Approach

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - A tree is symmetric if it is a mirror image of itself around its center.
  - This means that the left subtree is a mirror image of the right subtree at each level.
  - To check this, we need to ensure that:
    - The left child of the left subtree equals the right child of the right subtree, and vice versa, at each corresponding level.
  
- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    - Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]`
    - Output: `true` (the tree is symmetric)
  - **Example 2**:
    - Input: `[1, 2, 2, null, 3, null, 3]`
    - Output: `false` (the tree is not symmetric)

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Binary tree traversal with symmetry checks.
- **Pattern**: Use an **iterative BFS-like approach** with a queue to process nodes in mirrored pairs, allowing us to avoid recursion.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To check for symmetry iteratively:
1. Use a queue to hold pairs of nodes that should be mirror images of each other.
2. Start by enqueuing the root node twice, representing a comparison between its left and right subtrees.
3. At each step:
   - Dequeue two nodes, `left` and `right`.
   - Check for symmetry:
     - If both nodes are `null`, they are symmetric; continue.
     - If only one is `null` or their values differ, the tree is not symmetric, so return `false`.
   - If both nodes are valid and have matching values, enqueue their children in a mirrored order:
     - Enqueue `left->left` and `right->right`.
     - Enqueue `left->right` and `right->left`.
4. If the queue is exhausted without finding any mismatches, the tree is symmetric, so return `true`.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the C++ code implementing the iterative approach with a queue:

```cpp
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode *left;
    TreeNode *right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool isSymmetric(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return true; // An empty tree is symmetric by definition

        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);
        q.push(root);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            TreeNode* left = q.front(); q.pop();
            TreeNode* right = q.front(); q.pop();

            // Check symmetry conditions
            if (!left && !right) continue; // Both nodes are null, so they are symmetric
            if (!left || !right || left->val != right->val) return false; // Mismatch found

            // Enqueue children in mirrored order to check symmetry level by level
            q.push(left->left);
            q.push(right->right);
            q.push(left->right);
            q.push(right->left);
        }

        return true; // If we complete without finding asymmetry, the tree is symmetric
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Queue Initialization**:
   - Start by adding two references to the `root` node to the queue, representing the left and right subtrees of the root.
   
2. **Iterative Check Using Queue**:
   - We dequeue two nodes at a time and check if they are mirror images:
     - If both nodes are `null`, they are symmetric, so continue.
     - If only one node is `null` or their values differ, the tree is not symmetric, so return `false`.
   - If the nodes match, enqueue their children in mirrored order:
     - Enqueue `(left->left, right->right)` and `(left->right, right->left)` to ensure we’re checking corresponding nodes on each side.

3. **Completion**:
   - If the queue is exhausted without detecting any asymmetry, return `true`, indicating that the tree is symmetric.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - We visit each node once during the traversal, checking it with its mirror node.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the maximum number of nodes at any level of the tree.
  - In the worst case, the queue can contain up to half the nodes of the tree, which is \(O(n)\) for a complete binary tree.

This iterative solution efficiently checks for tree symmetry by comparing pairs of nodes level by level using a queue, providing a clear and non-recursive way to validate symmetry in a binary tree.
