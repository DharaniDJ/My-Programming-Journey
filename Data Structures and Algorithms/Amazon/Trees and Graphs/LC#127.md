### Problem Statement

- We are given a `beginWord`, an `endWord`, and a `wordList`.
- We need to transform `beginWord` into `endWord` by changing only one letter at a time.
- Each intermediate word in the sequence must be in `wordList`.
- We return the minimum number of transformations required to reach `endWord` from `beginWord`, or `0` if no such sequence exists.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - Each transformation step changes exactly one letter.
  - Each transformed word must exist in `wordList`.
  - The sequence ends when `beginWord` is transformed to `endWord`.
  - If `endWord` is not in `wordList`, return `0` immediately since there’s no way to reach it.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - **Example 1**:
    - Input: `beginWord = "hit"`, `endWord = "cog"`, `wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]`
    - Output: `5` (transformation: `"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"`)
  - **Example 2**:
    - Input: `beginWord = "hit"`, `endWord = "cog"`, `wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]`
    - Output: `0` (no possible transformation to reach "cog")

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Shortest path problem in an implicit graph.
- **Pattern**: Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a natural fit since it explores the shortest path level by level.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
We can think of each word as a node in a graph and an edge exists between two nodes if the words differ by only one letter. We use BFS to explore these nodes level by level, and the first time we reach `endWord`, we know we’ve found the shortest transformation sequence.

### Steps

1. **Set Up Word Set**:
   - Convert `wordList` into a set (for `O(1)` lookups) and ensure that `endWord` is in this set. If not, return `0` immediately.

2. **Initialize BFS**:
   - Start with `beginWord`, add it to the BFS queue along with a level counter (starting at `1` to count `beginWord` as part of the sequence).
   - Use a queue to store the current word and its associated level.

3. **BFS Traversal**:
   - For each word in the queue, generate all possible words by changing one letter at a time.
   - For each generated word:
     - If the generated word is equal to `endWord`, return the current level + 1 (since it completes the transformation sequence).
     - If the generated word is in `wordList`, add it to the queue with an incremented level and remove it from `wordList` to prevent revisiting.
   
4. **Return 0 if No Transformation Found**:
   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching `endWord`, return `0`.

### Implementation in C++

Here’s the C++ code implementing the BFS approach:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <unordered_set>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    int ladderLength(string beginWord, string endWord, vector<string>& wordList) {
        unordered_set<string> wordSet(wordList.begin(), wordList.end());
        
        // If endWord is not in the wordList, no solution exists
        if (wordSet.find(endWord) == wordSet.end()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        queue<pair<string, int>> q;
        q.push({beginWord, 1}); // Start with beginWord and level 1

        while (!q.empty()) {
            auto [currentWord, level] = q.front();
            q.pop();

            // Try changing each character in the current word
            for (int i = 0; i < currentWord.length(); ++i) {
                string nextWord = currentWord;
                
                // Replace character with 'a' to 'z'
                for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; ++c) {
                    nextWord[i] = c;
                    
                    // Skip if the word is the same as current
                    if (nextWord == currentWord) continue;
                    
                    // Check if we have reached the end word
                    if (nextWord == endWord) return level + 1;
                    
                    // If nextWord is in the word set, add it to the queue
                    if (wordSet.find(nextWord) != wordSet.end()) {
                        q.push({nextWord, level + 1});
                        wordSet.erase(nextWord); // Remove to prevent revisits
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return 0; // If we exhaust the queue without finding the endWord
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialize Word Set**:
   - Convert `wordList` to an `unordered_set` called `wordSet` for quick lookups.
   - If `endWord` is not in `wordSet`, return `0` because there’s no way to reach `endWord`.

2. **Initialize BFS Queue**:
   - Start with the `beginWord` and an initial level of `1`.
   - The queue stores pairs of words and their corresponding levels in the transformation sequence.

3. **Process Each Word in the Queue**:
   - For each word, attempt to generate all possible single-letter transformations.
   - For each transformed word:
     - If it matches `endWord`, return `level + 1`.
     - If it exists in `wordSet`, enqueue it with an incremented level and remove it from `wordSet` to prevent revisiting the same word.
  
4. **Return `0` if `endWord` Not Found**:
   - If BFS completes without finding `endWord`, return `0`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(M * N)\), where:
  - \(M\) is the length of each word.
  - \(N\) is the total number of words in the `wordList`.
  - For each word in `wordList`, we try \(M\) single-letter transformations.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(M * N)\) for the queue and set used to store words.

This solution effectively finds the shortest transformation sequence by exploring each possible path level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach `endWord`, we’ve found the shortest path.
