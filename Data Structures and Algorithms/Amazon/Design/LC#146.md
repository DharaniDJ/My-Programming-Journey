To solve the problem of designing an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache, let’s use the UMPIRE approach for a structured solution.

---

### Problem Statement

Design a data structure that follows the constraints of an LRU cache, where:
- **LRU Cache**: Stores key-value pairs with a maximum capacity. When the cache reaches its capacity, it evicts the least recently used item to make room for a new item.
- The `LRUCache` class should support:
  - `LRUCache(int capacity)`: Initialize the cache with a given capacity.
  - `int get(int key)`: Return the value of the `key` if it exists in the cache, otherwise return `-1`.
  - `void put(int key, int value)`: Update the value of the key if it exists. Otherwise, add the key-value pair. If the cache exceeds its capacity, evict the least recently used key.
- Both `get` and `put` operations should run in \(O(1)\) time complexity.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - When a key is accessed via `get` or updated/inserted via `put`, it becomes the most recently used.
  - When the cache exceeds capacity, the least recently used (LRU) key should be removed.
  - `get` should return `-1` if the key does not exist in the cache.

- **Example Workflow**:
  - Example: For `capacity = 2`, if we perform the following operations:
    - `put(1, 1)`: Cache is `{1:1}`
    - `put(2, 2)`: Cache is `{1:1, 2:2}`
    - `get(1)`: Returns `1`, cache becomes `{2:2, 1:1}` (1 is now most recently used)
    - `put(3, 3)`: Cache exceeds capacity, evicts `2`, becomes `{1:1, 3:3}`
    - `get(2)`: Returns `-1` (2 was evicted)
    - `put(4, 4)`: Cache becomes `{3:3, 4:4}`, evicting `1`

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Data structure design with constraints on operations.
- **Pattern**: We need a way to efficiently track and update the order of elements based on usage. Using a **hash map** combined with a **doubly linked list** allows us to store key-value pairs and update their order in constant time.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To implement an LRU cache efficiently, we can use a combination of a hash map and a doubly linked list:
1. **Hash Map**: Stores key-node pairs, allowing \(O(1)\) access to nodes in the doubly linked list.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Maintains the order of elements by recency. The head of the list will represent the most recently used item, and the tail represents the least recently used item.

1. **Initialize the Data Structure**:
   - Define a doubly linked list with nodes containing `key` and `value` pairs.
   - The list has a dummy head and dummy tail to simplify adding/removing nodes.
   - Initialize a hash map to store references to nodes in the list.

2. **Define Operations**:
   - **Get Operation**: 
     - If the key is found in the map, move its node to the head (mark it as most recently used) and return the value.
     - If the key is not found, return `-1`.
   - **Put Operation**:
     - If the key exists, update its value and move it to the head.
     - If the key does not exist, add a new node to the head.
     - If adding the new node exceeds capacity, remove the tail node (least recently used) and update the map.

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - **Add Node to Head**: Insert a node right after the dummy head.
   - **Remove Node**: Remove a specific node.
   - **Move to Head**: Move a node to the head.
   - **Remove Tail**: Remove the least recently used node (tail node).

This structure ensures that `get` and `put` operations run in \(O(1)\) time complexity.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ implementation of the LRU Cache:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int key;
    int val;
    Node *next;
    Node *prev;
    Node(int key, int val) : key(key), val(val), next(nullptr), prev(nullptr) {}
};

class LRUCache {
public:
    Node* head = new Node(-1, -1);
    Node* tail = new Node(-1, -1);
    unordered_map<int, Node*> mp;
    int capacity;

    LRUCache(int capacity) {
        this->capacity = capacity;
        head->next = tail;
        tail->prev = head;    
    }
    
    int get(int key) {
        if(mp.find(key)==mp.end()){
            return -1;
        }

        Node* node = mp[key];
        remove(node);
        add(node);
        return node->val;
    }
    
    void put(int key, int value) {
        if(mp.find(key)!=mp.end()){
            Node* oldNode = mp[key];
            remove(oldNode);
        }

        Node *node = new Node(key, value);
        mp[key] = node;
        add(node);

        if(mp.size()>capacity){
            Node* frontNode = head->next;
            remove(frontNode);
            mp.erase(frontNode->key);
        }
    }

    void add(Node* node){
        Node* prevEnd = tail->prev;
        prevEnd->next = node;
        node->prev = prevEnd;
        node->next = tail;
        tail->prev = node;
    }

    void remove(Node* node){
        node->prev->next = node->next;
        node->next->prev = node->prev;
    }
};

/**
 * Your LRUCache object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * LRUCache* obj = new LRUCache(capacity);
 * int param_1 = obj->get(key);
 * obj->put(key,value);
 */
```

#### **5. Review**
- **Example Walkthrough**:
  - Initialize with `capacity = 2`.
  - `put(1, 1)`: Adds `(1,1)` to the cache.
  - `put(2, 2)`: Adds `(2,2)` to the cache, with the cache state `{1:1, 2:2}`.
  - `get(1)`: Returns `1` and moves `(1,1)` to the head. Cache state is `{2:2, 1:1}`.
  - `put(3, 3)`: Cache exceeds capacity, so evict `(2,2)`. Cache becomes `{1:1, 3:3}`.

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - If `get` is called on a non-existent key, it returns `-1`.
  - If `put` exceeds the capacity, the least recently used item is removed.

#### **6. Evaluate**
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for both `get` and `put`, as all operations (insertions, deletions, updates) on the linked list and hash map are constant-time.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(capacity)\), as we store up to `capacity` elements in the cache.
- **Strengths**: Efficient access and update operations with minimal space usage.
- **Weaknesses**: None; this approach is optimal for the problem requirements.

This solution efficiently maintains an LRU cache by using a combination of a hash map and a doubly linked list, achieving optimal time complexity for `get` and `put` operations.
