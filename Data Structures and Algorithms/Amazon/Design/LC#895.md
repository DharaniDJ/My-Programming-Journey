### Problem Statement

Design a stack-like data structure that supports:
1. **`push(int val)`**: Pushes an integer `val` onto the stack.
2. **`pop()`**: Removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack. If multiple elements have the same highest frequency, remove and return the one closest to the stack's top.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - The most frequent element is the one that appears most frequently in the stack. If two or more elements have the same frequency, we return the one that was pushed last among them.
  - We need a way to track the frequency of each element and also keep elements with the same frequency in the order they were added.

- **Example Workflow**:
  - For `push(5), push(7), push(5), push(7), push(4), push(5)`, then `pop()` should return `5` (as `5` has the highest frequency).
  - After the first pop, calling `pop()` again should return `7` (as `7` and `5` both have a frequency of 2, but `7` was pushed last among the highest frequency elements).

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Data structure design with stack and frequency tracking.
- **Pattern**: We need to track the frequency of elements and maintain multiple stacks based on frequency.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To meet the requirements, we need to efficiently track both the frequency of each element and the order in which elements with the same frequency were pushed:
1. **Use a Hash Map for Frequency Tracking**:
   - Maintain a `frequency` hash map that stores the frequency of each element.

2. **Use a Hash Map of Stacks for Frequency Groups**:
   - Use another hash map, `group`, where each key is a frequency, and the value is a stack of elements with that frequency.
   - For example, `group[2]` contains all elements with a frequency of 2, in the order they were added.

3. **Track the Maximum Frequency**:
   - Keep a variable `maxFreq` to track the current highest frequency in the stack.
   - This allows `pop()` to access the stack corresponding to `maxFreq` directly, ensuring we pop the most frequent element in \(O(1)\).

### Steps for Each Operation

1. **Push Operation (`push`)**:
   - Increment the frequency of `val` in `frequency[val]`.
   - Push `val` onto the stack at `group[frequency[val]]`.
   - Update `maxFreq` if `frequency[val]` is greater than the current `maxFreq`.

2. **Pop Operation (`pop`)**:
   - Get the element at the top of the stack at `group[maxFreq]` (this is the most frequent and most recent element).
   - Remove this element from the stack.
   - Decrement its frequency in `frequency[val]`.
   - If `group[maxFreq]` becomes empty after the pop, decrement `maxFreq`.

This approach ensures \(O(1)\) operations for both `push` and `pop`.

#### **4. Implement**

Hereâ€™s the C++ code for the `FreqStack` class:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

class FreqStack {
private:
    unordered_map<int, int> frequency;                  // Maps each element to its frequency
    unordered_map<int, stack<int>> group;               // Maps each frequency to a stack of elements with that frequency
    int maxFreq = 0;                                    // Tracks the current maximum frequency

public:
    FreqStack() {}

    void push(int val) {
        // Increment the frequency of val
        frequency[val]++;
        int freq = frequency[val];
        
        // If this frequency is a new max, update maxFreq
        if (freq > maxFreq) {
            maxFreq = freq;
        }
        
        // Add val to the stack corresponding to its frequency
        group[freq].push(val);
    }
    
    int pop() {
        // Get the most frequent element
        int val = group[maxFreq].top();
        group[maxFreq].pop();
        
        // Decrement the frequency of val
        frequency[val]--;
        
        // If there are no more elements at the current maxFreq, reduce maxFreq
        if (group[maxFreq].empty()) {
            maxFreq--;
        }
        
        return val;
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Frequency Tracking (`frequency`)**:
   - `frequency[val]` stores the current frequency of `val`.

2. **Grouping Elements by Frequency (`group`)**:
   - `group[freq]` is a stack of elements with the frequency `freq`. The most recently added element is at the top, which ensures that when we pop, we get the most recent element among the most frequent elements.

3. **Max Frequency (`maxFreq`)**:
   - `maxFreq` keeps track of the highest frequency among elements in the stack, allowing efficient access to the stack of most frequent elements.

4. **Push Operation**:
   - We increment the frequency of `val`, update `maxFreq` if necessary, and push `val` onto `group[frequency[val]]`.

5. **Pop Operation**:
   - We retrieve and remove the top element from `group[maxFreq]`.
   - We decrement the frequency of this element. If `group[maxFreq]` becomes empty, we decrement `maxFreq`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Push**: \(O(1)\), as we perform constant-time operations for hash map updates and stack operations.
  - **Pop**: \(O(1)\), as we access `group[maxFreq]` directly and adjust `frequency` and `maxFreq` in constant time.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements pushed into the `FreqStack`. We store each element in both `frequency` and `group`, leading to a linear space requirement.

This solution ensures efficient \(O(1)\) `push` and `pop` operations by using hash maps and stacks to track frequencies and maintain access to the most frequent elements.
