### Problem Statement

Design an autocomplete system that:
1. Returns the top 3 most frequent historical sentences with a prefix matching the current input.
2. Tracks the frequency of each sentence and updates it when a new sentence is completed (indicated by `#`).
3. If multiple sentences have the same frequency, they should be sorted in lexicographical order.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - For each character input (other than `#`), return the top 3 historical sentences with the same prefix as the currently typed sentence.
  - If there are fewer than 3 matches, return as many as you can.
  - When `#` is entered, finalize and save the current sentence, and reset for a new input.

- **Example Input and Output**:
  - Input: sentences = `["i love you", "island", "iroman", "i love leetcode"]`, times = `[5, 3, 2, 2]`
  - After `input('i')`, returns top sentences starting with `"i"`: `["i love you", "island", "i love leetcode"]`.
  - After `input(' ')`, returns top sentences starting with `"i "`: `["i love you", "i love leetcode"]`.

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Trie-based data structure with prefix matching and frequency tracking.
- **Pattern**: 
  - A **Trie (prefix tree)** allows efficient prefix-based lookup, and we can store each sentence along with its frequency.
  - By using a **priority queue (min-heap)**, we can track the top 3 sentences with the highest frequency for each prefix in real-time.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To efficiently autocomplete and track sentence frequencies:
1. Use a **Trie** structure where each node contains a map from character to the next Trie node. This allows efficient prefix lookup.
2. Each Trie node also maintains a list of sentences with the highest frequency (top 3).
3. For each sentence, traverse the Trie and insert the sentence at each prefix node along with its frequency.

### Steps for Each Operation

1. **Initialize the Data Structure**:
   - Insert each sentence into the Trie. As you insert, keep track of the frequency for each prefix so that you can retrieve the top 3 hot sentences quickly.

2. **Input a Character (`input(char c)`)**:
   - If `c` is not `#`:
     - Update the current prefix by adding `c` to it.
     - Traverse the Trie to find the node representing this prefix, and return the top 3 sentences stored at this node.
   - If `c` is `#`:
     - This marks the end of the current sentence. Update the Trie with this completed sentence and increase its frequency by 1.
     - Reset the current prefix to start fresh.

### Implementation Details

1. **Trie Node Structure**:
   - Each node stores a map of children (for the next character in the sentence) and a map of sentences to their frequency.
   
2. **Helper Functions**:
   - **Insert Sentence**: Insert a sentence into the Trie, updating the frequency map at each node along the path.
   - **Retrieve Top 3**: For a given prefix, retrieve the top 3 sentences from the frequency map at the corresponding Trie node.

### Implementation in C++

Hereâ€™s the C++ code for the `AutocompleteSystem` class:

```cpp
#include <unordered_map>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

struct TrieNode {
    unordered_map<char, TrieNode*> children;
    unordered_map<string, int> frequency;
};

class AutocompleteSystem {
private:
    TrieNode* root;
    string currentInput;

    // Helper function to insert a sentence into the Trie
    void insertSentence(const string& sentence, int count) {
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (char c : sentence) {
            if (!node->children.count(c)) {
                node->children[c] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node->children[c];
            node->frequency[sentence] += count;
        }
    }

    // Helper function to retrieve the top 3 hot sentences from a frequency map
    vector<string> getTop3Sentences(unordered_map<string, int>& freqMap) {
        auto comp = [&](const string& a, const string& b) {
            return freqMap[a] == freqMap[b] ? a > b : freqMap[a] < freqMap[b];
        };
        
        priority_queue<string, vector<string>, decltype(comp)> minHeap(comp);
        
        for (const auto& [sentence, freq] : freqMap) {
            minHeap.push(sentence);
            if (minHeap.size() > 3) {
                minHeap.pop();
            }
        }
        
        vector<string> result;
        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            result.push_back(minHeap.top());
            minHeap.pop();
        }
        reverse(result.begin(), result.end()); // Convert to descending order
        return result;
    }

public:
    AutocompleteSystem(vector<string>& sentences, vector<int>& times) {
        root = new TrieNode();
        currentInput = "";
        for (int i = 0; i < sentences.size(); ++i) {
            insertSentence(sentences[i], times[i]);
        }
    }

    vector<string> input(char c) {
        if (c == '#') {
            insertSentence(currentInput, 1); // End of sentence, add it to Trie
            currentInput = "";               // Reset for new input
            return {};
        }
        
        currentInput += c;
        TrieNode* node = root;
        for (char ch : currentInput) {
            if (!node->children.count(ch)) {
                return {}; // No matching prefix
            }
            node = node->children[ch];
        }
        
        // Get top 3 hot sentences for the current prefix
        return getTop3Sentences(node->frequency);
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **TrieNode Structure**:
   - Each node in the Trie has:
     - `children`: A map of characters to the next Trie nodes.
     - `frequency`: A map of sentences to their frequencies for efficient retrieval.

2. **Insert Sentence**:
   - Traverse each character in the sentence and move down the Trie, creating new nodes as needed.
   - At each node, update the frequency of the sentence in the `frequency` map.

3. **Retrieve Top 3 Sentences**:
   - We use a min-heap (priority queue) of size 3 to maintain the top 3 hot sentences efficiently.
   - Sentences are ordered by frequency and lexicographical order in case of a tie.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - When a character is entered, it updates the prefix and retrieves top 3 matches.
   - When `#` is entered, the completed sentence is added to the Trie and the prefix resets.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Insertion (insertSentence)**: \(O(m \log 3)\) per character for each sentence, where \(m\) is the length of the sentence.
  - **Query (input)**: \(O(p \log 3)\) where \(p\) is the length of the current prefix, due to the retrieval of top 3 sentences.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n * m)\), where \(n\) is the number of sentences and \(m\) is the average length of a sentence, due to storing sentences and their frequencies in the Trie.

This solution efficiently provides prefix-based autocompletion by leveraging a Trie structure with frequency tracking at each node.
