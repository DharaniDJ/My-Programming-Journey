### Problem Statement

Design a `TicTacToe` class for an \( n * n \) board:
1. **Initialization**: `TicTacToe(int n)` initializes an \( n * n \) board.
2. **Move**: `int move(int row, int col, int player)` places a move on the board at `(row, col)` by `player`.
   - Return `0` if no player has won after this move.
   - Return `1` if `player 1` wins after this move.
   - Return `2` if `player 2` wins after this move.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - The game stops when a player places `n` of their marks in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
  - After each move, we need to check if the move creates a winning line of `n` marks.
  - A winning condition could occur in three ways:
    - Row completion
    - Column completion
    - Diagonal or anti-diagonal completion

- **Example**:
  - For a 3x3 board, player 1 could win by filling any row, column, or one of the diagonals.
  
#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Game implementation with constant-time win checking.
- **Pattern**: By maintaining counts for each row, column, diagonal, and anti-diagonal, we can efficiently check for winning conditions without scanning the entire board after each move.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To determine if a player has won, we only need to track the counts of each player's moves in each row, column, diagonal, and anti-diagonal:
1. **Row and Column Tracking**:
   - Maintain arrays for each row and column to count moves for each player.
   - If a player’s count reaches `n` in any row or column, they win.

2. **Diagonal Tracking**:
   - Use two counters for the main diagonal and anti-diagonal.
   - If a player’s count reaches `n` in either diagonal, they win.

3. **Win Condition**:
   - After every move, check if any of the counters for that player in the row, column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal has reached `n`.

This approach ensures constant-time checks for each move.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
   - Use arrays to keep track of counts for rows and columns for each player.
   - Use separate counters for the main diagonal and anti-diagonal.

2. **Process Each Move**:
   - Update the row and column counts for the player.
   - If the move is on the main diagonal (`row == col`), update the diagonal counter.
   - If the move is on the anti-diagonal (`row + col == n - 1`), update the anti-diagonal counter.
   - Check if any counter reaches `n`, indicating a win.

3. **Return Result**:
   - If a counter reaches `n`, return the player ID.
   - If no win condition is met, return `0`.

### Code Implementation

Here’s the C++ implementation of the `TicTacToe` class:

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class TicTacToe {
private:
    vector<int> rows, cols;
    int diagonal, antiDiagonal;
    int n;

public:
    TicTacToe(int n) : rows(n, 0), cols(n, 0), diagonal(0), antiDiagonal(0), n(n) {}

    int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int add = (player == 1) ? 1 : -1; // Use 1 for player 1, -1 for player 2

        // Update row and column
        rows[row] += add;
        cols[col] += add;

        // Update diagonals if applicable
        if (row == col) diagonal += add;
        if (row + col == n - 1) antiDiagonal += add;

        // Check if any of the counts reach n or -n
        if (abs(rows[row]) == n || abs(cols[col]) == n ||
            abs(diagonal) == n || abs(antiDiagonal) == n) {
            return player;
        }

        return 0; // No winner
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - `rows` and `cols` vectors track the cumulative counts for each row and column.
   - `diagonal` and `antiDiagonal` integers track the main diagonal and anti-diagonal counts.
   - We set `n` to store the board size.

2. **Move**:
   - `add` is `1` for player 1 and `-1` for player 2, allowing us to differentiate players.
   - We update `rows[row]` and `cols[col]` by `add` to reflect the player’s move.
   - If the move is on the main diagonal (`row == col`), update `diagonal`.
   - If the move is on the anti-diagonal (`row + col == n - 1`), update `antiDiagonal`.
   - If any count reaches `n` (for player 1) or `-n` (for player 2), we return the player ID as the winner.

3. **Win Condition Check**:
   - If any row, column, or diagonal count reaches `n` (indicating a winning condition for player 1) or `-n` (indicating a winning condition for player 2), return the player as the winner.
   - If no condition is met, return `0`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\) for each `move`, as we are simply updating and checking counters.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the `rows` and `cols` vectors.

This solution efficiently handles the TicTacToe game with constant-time checks for a win condition after each move.
