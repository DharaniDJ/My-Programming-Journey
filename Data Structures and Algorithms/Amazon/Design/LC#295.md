### Problem Statement

Design a data structure that supports:
1. `MedianFinder()`: Initializes the data structure.
2. `void addNum(int num)`: Adds an integer `num` to the data structure.
3. `double findMedian()`: Returns the median of all elements added so far.

### UMPIRE Breakdown

#### **1. Understand**
- **Clarifications**:
  - We are dealing with a stream of integers, where each integer is added one by one.
  - The task is to design an efficient data structure that allows adding numbers and finding the median efficiently.
  - Finding the median in a sorted list of elements can be done in \(O(1)\) if we have a way to access the middle elements directly, without requiring the entire list to be sorted.

- **Example Workflow**:
  - For `addNum(1), addNum(2), findMedian()`, we expect `findMedian()` to return `(1 + 2) / 2 = 1.5`.
  - For `addNum(3), findMedian()`, we expect `findMedian()` to return `2`.

#### **2. Match**
- **Problem Type**: Data structure design with efficient insertion and median retrieval.
- **Pattern**: We want to maintain access to the middle elements for fast median retrieval without keeping the entire list sorted.

#### **3. Plan**

**Intuition**:
To access the median efficiently without sorting the entire input, we can utilize heaps:
1. **Median Access**:
   - We don’t need the entire list in sorted order; we only need quick access to the middle elements.
   - This can be achieved with two heaps:
     - A **max-heap** (priority queue) for the smaller half of the numbers.
     - A **min-heap** for the larger half of the numbers.
   
2. **Heap Properties**:
   - The **max-heap** stores the smaller half of the numbers, where the maximum element (top) represents the largest of the smaller half.
   - The **min-heap** stores the larger half of the numbers, where the minimum element (top) represents the smallest of the larger half.
   - This way, the median is either the top of the max-heap, the top of the min-heap, or the average of both.

3. **Balancing Heaps**:
   - To maintain balance:
     - If the max-heap has more than one extra element compared to the min-heap, move the top of the max-heap to the min-heap.
     - If the min-heap has more elements than the max-heap, move the top of the min-heap to the max-heap.
   - This balance ensures that either both heaps have the same number of elements (even count) or the max-heap has one extra element (odd count).

### Steps for Each Operation

1. **Add Number (`addNum`)**:
   - If `num` is less than or equal to the top of the max-heap, add `num` to the max-heap.
   - Otherwise, add `num` to the min-heap.
   - Balance the heaps:
     - If the max-heap has more than one extra element compared to the min-heap, move the top of the max-heap to the min-heap.
     - If the min-heap has more elements than the max-heap, move the top of the min-heap to the max-heap.

2. **Find Median (`findMedian`)**:
   - If the max-heap has more elements, the median is the top of the max-heap.
   - If both heaps have the same number of elements, the median is the average of the tops of both heaps.

This approach ensures that `addNum` and `findMedian` operations are performed in \(O(\log n)\) and \(O(1)\) time, respectively.

#### **4. Implement**

Here’s the C++ code for the `MedianFinder` class:

```cpp
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

class MedianFinder {
private:
    priority_queue<int> maxHeap; // Max-heap for the lower half
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap; // Min-heap for the upper half

public:
    MedianFinder() {}

    void addNum(int num) {
        // Add to maxHeap if it's empty or num <= maxHeap's top
        if (maxHeap.empty() || num <= maxHeap.top()) {
            maxHeap.push(num);
        } else {
            minHeap.push(num);
        }
        
        // Balance the heaps if needed
        if (maxHeap.size() > minHeap.size() + 1) {
            minHeap.push(maxHeap.top());
            maxHeap.pop();
        } else if (minHeap.size() > maxHeap.size()) {
            maxHeap.push(minHeap.top());
            minHeap.pop();
        }
    }
    
    double findMedian() {
        if (maxHeap.size() > minHeap.size()) {
            return maxHeap.top(); // Odd number of elements, max-heap has the median
        } else {
            return (maxHeap.top() + minHeap.top()) / 2.0; // Even number of elements, average the tops
        }
    }
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Heaps**:
   - `maxHeap` stores the smaller half of the numbers (using default max-heap behavior).
   - `minHeap` stores the larger half of the numbers (using `greater<int>` to make it a min-heap).

2. **addNum**:
   - If `num` is less than or equal to the top of `maxHeap`, it belongs in `maxHeap`.
   - Otherwise, it goes into `minHeap`.
   - After adding, we balance the heaps so that:
     - The max-heap has at most one more element than the min-heap.

3. **findMedian**:
   - If the max-heap has one extra element, it holds the median (odd number of elements).
   - If both heaps are balanced, the median is the average of the tops of both heaps (even number of elements).

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**:
  - **addNum**: \(O(\log n)\), as inserting into a heap takes \(O(\log n)\) time.
  - **findMedian**: \(O(1)\), as accessing the tops of the heaps is constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\), as we store all elements in the two heaps.

This solution efficiently achieves fast median retrieval by maintaining two balanced heaps, using \(O(\log n)\) time for insertion and \(O(1)\) time for median retrieval.
