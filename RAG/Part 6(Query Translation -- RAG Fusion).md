# RAG From Scratch: Part 6 (Query Translation -- RAG Fusion)

Welcome to the sixth part in the **RAG From Scratch** series. This readme focuses on **RAG Fusion**, a method for query translation in advanced RAG pipelines.

## Introduction to Query Translation

Query translation is an advanced stage in RAG pipelines aimed at improving retrieval by translating user queries. It involves several approaches:

1. **Rewriting**: Reframe the query from different perspectives.
2. **Sub-questions**: Break down the query into smaller, more manageable questions.
3. **Step-back**: Make the query more abstract to address higher-level questions.

### RAG Fusion

RAG Fusion is a specific rewriting approach that includes a clever ranking step called **Reciprocal Rank Fusion**. This method involves:

1. **Rewriting the Query**: Break the query into multiple differently worded questions.
2. **Retrieving Documents**: Perform retrieval for each rewritten query.
3. **Ranking Documents**: Use Reciprocal Rank Fusion to aggregate and rank the retrieved documents into a final consolidated list.

### Workflow

1. **Generate Multiple Queries**: Reframe the input question into multiple queries.
2. **Retrieve Documents**: Perform retrieval for each query.
3. **Rank Documents**: Use Reciprocal Rank Fusion to rank and consolidate the retrieved documents.
4. **Generate Final Answer**: Pass the ranked documents to the LLM to generate the final answer.

### Example Code

Below is a quick code walkthrough for RAG Fusion:

```python
# Load and split documents
documents = load_documents("path/to/documents")
chunks = split_documents(documents, chunk_size=512)

# Specify embedding model
embedding_model = "openai"

# Embed and index chunks
vector_store = VectorStore(embedding_model=embedding_model, storage="chroma")
for chunk in chunks:
    vector = embed_text(chunk, model=embedding_model)
    vector_store.index(vector, document=chunk)

# Define retriever
retriever = vector_store.get_retriever()

# Define prompt for multi-query
multi_query_prompt = "You are an assistant. Your task is to reframe this question into a few different sub-questions: {question}"

# Define LLM
llm = LLM(model="gpt-3.5")

# Generate multiple queries
def generate_queries(question):
    prompt = multi_query_prompt.format(question=question)
    response = llm.generate(prompt)
    queries = response.split('\n')
    return queries

# Example question
question = "What is task decomposition?"

# Generate and retrieve documents for each query
queries = generate_queries(question)
all_documents = []
for q in queries:
    documents = retriever.retrieve(q, k=1)
    all_documents.extend(documents)

# Reciprocal Rank Fusion
def reciprocal_rank_fusion(doc_lists):
    # Implement the ranking logic here
    ranked_docs = rank_documents(doc_lists)
    return ranked_docs

# Rank and consolidate documents
ranked_documents = reciprocal_rank_fusion(all_documents)

# Define final prompt template
final_prompt_template = "Answer the following question based on this context: {context}\nQuestion: {question}"

# Generate final answer
context = "\n".join(ranked_documents)
final_prompt = final_prompt_template.format(context=context, question=question)
final_answer = llm.generate(final_prompt)
print(final_answer)
```

### Observability with LSmith

Using LSmith for tracing and observability is recommended. It helps in understanding the intermediate steps and the final retrieval results.

## Conclusion

This readme provides a deep dive into the RAG Fusion approach for query translation in RAG pipelines. Next readme will explore other methods to improve retrieval and address limitations in this basic pipeline.
